We infer non-tariff barriers from the change in imports of U.S. products relative to imports from other countries of the same HS-6 product, after controlling for the change in the relative price of U.S. imports to the same product sold by other countries.  These barriers were imposed on a small number of agricultural products, did not apply to state-owned importers, and were larger for products where the share of state importers in total imports of the U.S. product was large.  Non-tariff barriers were responsible for more than 90\\% of the welfare cost to Chinese consumers of the U.S.-China trade war.  The welfare loss to China of a given reduction in imports from the U.S. from non-tariff barriers is about six times larger than an equivalent import decline due to higher tariffs.  Non-tariff barriers are more costly compared to tariffs because they applied to some importers and not others, which results in misallocation, and because non-tariff barriers do not generate revenues."

Air cargo is many times more expensive than maritime transport but arrives in destination markets much faster. We model firms' choice between exporting goods using fast but expensive air cargo and slow but cheap ocean cargo.  This choice depends on the price elasticity of demand and the value that consumers attach to fast delivery and is revealed in the relative market shares of firms who air and ocean ship.  We use US imports data that provide rich variation in the premium paid for air shipping and in time lags for ocean transit to identify these parameters and extract consumer's valuation of time.  By exploiting variation across US entry coasts we are able to control for selection and for unobserved shocks to product quality and variety that affect market shares.   We estimate that each day in transit is equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 0.6 to 2.3 percent and that the most time-sensitive trade flows are those involving parts and components trade.  These results suggest a link between sharp declines in the price of air shipping and rapid growth in trade as well as growth in world-wide fragmentation of production.  Our estimates are also useful for assessing the economic impact of policies that raise or lower time to trade such as security screening of cargo, port infrastructure investment, or streamlined customs procedures."

According to traditional trade theory, the gains will come only with permanent resource migration and significant factor price changes (since in principle all trade barriers have already been removed). Yet, it seems unlikely that the 1992 reforms will be completed, if they do indeed result in factor movements large enough to substantially alter factor rewards. This paper presents a more optimistic view. It argues that factor market integration can result in economic gains, even without capital and labor migration. The basic argument is simple. For some types of goods, it is cheaper to conduct trade on an intra-firm basis, rather than an inter-firm basis (for instance roughly half of US imports are intra-firm, Helleiner [1981]). In such industries, any factor market barrier that raises the cost of foreign control of local firms also raises the cost of intra-firm trade. Consequently, removing such barriers can lead to gains from trade. The 1.0. trade literature points out that intra-firm trade requires direct foreign control which need not involve direct foreign investment (Helpman and Krugman [19851). Therefore, 1992 can logically lead to gains from additional intra-firm trade, with little additional capital or labor migration."

I show that this will always be the case if the economy is small enough. The crucial factor in this complete reversal of standard results is the impact of tariffs on domestic real product wages via wage indexation. Temporary tariffs will have less of a negative impact on the CA or potentially even a positive impact, because they increase the consumption rate of interest (the terms at which future consumption can be traded for current consumption) and so increase private savings. Extensions towards incorporating a more general production structure, investment and the use of tariff revenues to provide wage subsidies are presented."

Applying the model to tariff shocks, we quantify their effects on prices, income, spending, and trade imbalances. We find that higher U.S. tariffs reduce the U.S. trade deficit through general equilibrium adjustments, but raise domestic prices and lower real consumption. Our findings highlight that movements in trade imbalances are shaped by the structure of global trade and finance, and that attempts to influence external balances through changes in trade barriers carry significant implications for real economic outcomes."

We use an econometric framework that allows for the simultaneous determination of trade barriers and trade flows.  Our results are consistent with political-economy theories of the determinants of protection: even after accounting for industry-specific factors, nations tend to protect industries that are weak, in decline, and threatened by import competition.  Countries also give more protection to large industries; these might be thought of as politically important.  Nations use tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and exchange rate controls as complementary instruments of protection."

The extent of industrial policy is non-monotonic in both the size of the demand shock and in its variance."

We analyze the short-run impact of this return to protectionism on the U.S. economy. Import and retaliatory tariffs caused large declines in imports and exports. Prices of imports targeted by tariffs did not fall, implying complete pass-through of tariffs to duty-inclusive prices. The resulting losses to U.S. consumers and firms who buy imports was $51 billion, or 0.27% of GDP. We embed the estimated trade elasticities in a general-equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. After accounting for tariff revenue and gains to domestic producers, the aggregate real income loss was $7.2 billion, or 0.04% of GDP. Import tariffs favored sectors concentrated in politically competitive counties, and the model implies that tradeable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties were the most negatively affected due to the retaliatory tariffs."

We report several findings which are hard to reconcile with the canonical theory. First, we find a striking independence of self-perceived risk and the price of insurance.  Second, we find strong evidence of the opposite type of non-linear pricing than predicted by theory:  the theory predicts that prices rise with quantity, but we find that they fall. Third, we find that risk is negatively correlated with the quantity of insurance purchased although the theory predicts a positive correlation.  Fourth, we find that a substantial fraction of individuals hold multiple insurance contracts, which casts doubt on the prediction that unit prices rise with quantity because multiple small contracts dominate a large one in such a case.  Lastly, we test the accuracy of the self-perceived risk of the insured through estimating the induced profits they imply.  We conclude by discussing the robustness of these results and the questions they raise for future theoretical models."

The key mechanism is that a society's willingness to invest in improving institutions that constrain rent-seeking behavior is influenced by the natural barriers. Two types of empirical evidence support the theoretical predictions. First, \"natural\" barriers beget policy barriers - countries with more \"natural\" barriers tend to have higher tariffs and more NTBs. Second, liberalization begets liberalization - in response to unilateral trade reforms in China in the early 2000s, those other countries that benefit more from the Chinese liberalization also undertake more liberalization of their own."

Estimates from country-level and panel VARs show that protectionism acts as a supply shock, causing output to fall and inflation to rise in the short run. Moreover, protectionism has at best a small positive effect on the trade balance. Second, we build a small open economy model with firm heterogeneity, endogenous selection into trade, and nominal rigidity to study the channels through which protectionism affects aggregate fluctuations. The model successfully reproduces the VAR evidence and highlights the importance of aggregate investment dynamics and micro-level reallocations for the contractionary effects of tariffs. We then use the model to study scenarios where temporary trade barriers have been advocated as potentially beneficial, including recessions with binding constraints on monetary policy easing or in the presence of a fixed exchange rate. Our main conclusion is that, in all the scenarios we consider, protectionism is not an effective tool for macroeconomic stimulus."

Here we examine the economic-political determinants of RTBs and their effects on trade. Because of their wasteful nature, RTBs have very different implications from those of more traditional trade barriers. In particular, RTBs have important impacts on the extensive margin of trade, and respond in non-standard ways to changes in tariffs and natural trade costs. We argue that taking into account the endogenous response of RTBs is crucial for understanding the effects of tariff liberalization and globalization on trade and welfare."

Often, this outcome is attributed to the lack of fiscal capacity in Latin American countries. Instead, we develop a simple political economy game where the populist government may use trade policy to encourage capitalists to invest in the more labor-intensive industry. Since moving capital is costly, those capitalists will support the continuation of the protectionist trade policy even after the populist government falls from power. The populist government may therefore choose to implement the less efficient but politically-sustainable policy instead of the more efficient policy that will be easily overturned after a regime change. Building fiscal capacity does not change the equilibrium. Only a long run commitment to a minimum level of redistribution restores efficiency."

Instead of fostering talent growth, these measures resulted in a significant decline in hiring for critical science and engineering roles, particularly in entry-level positions and at firms heavily impacted by tariffs. Companies heavily reliant on foreign talent cut back on domestic recruitment and instead shifted to hiring in countries with more favorable immigration policies. US protectionism also discouraged students from pursuing chip-related degrees, leading to a contraction in the domestic talent pipeline. Our conceptual model, which demonstrates how labor supply constraints and rising costs undermine the effectiveness of protectionism, provides a theoretical foundation for these findings."

We use a bank-level panel data set spanning all British and foreign banks providing loans within the United Kingdom between 1997Q3 and 2010Q1.  During this time, a number of banks were nationalised, privatised, given unusual access to loan or credit guarantees, or received capital injections.  We use standard empirical panel-data techniques to study the \"loan mix,\" domestic (British) loans of a bank expressed as a fraction of its total loan activity.  We also study effective short-term interest rates, though our data set here is much smaller.  We examine the loan mix for both British and foreign banks, both before and after unusual public interventions such as nationalisations and public capital injections.  We find strong evidence of financial protectionism.  After nationalisations, foreign banks reduced the fraction of loans going to the UK by about eleven percentage points and increased their effective interest rates by about 70 basis points.  By way of contrast, nationalised British banks did not significantly change either their loan mix or effective interest rates. Succinctly, foreign nationalised banks seem to have engaged in financial protectionism, while British nationalised banks have not."

We find that losses in foreign trade with retaliatory countries outweigh the gains from trade with non-retaliatory countries by more than USD 14.4 billion. Our results also indicate that non-retaliatory countries accommodated the increased demand from retaliatory countries by reorienting their trade relationships. We find that countries in South America and Europe benefited the most from these adjustments gaining more than USD 13.5 billion in additional foreign sales. The effects of retaliatory tariff increases across products vary substantially, with soybeans and meat products experiencing the most considerable redistribution effects."

We analyze how the equilibrium interest rate evolves during the transition to higher unilateral tariffs and a global trade war. In the short run, tariffs reduce capital demand, and so the natural rate of interest must fall for households\u2019 asset supply to line up with capital demand. In the long run, both asset supply and capital demand fall by similar amounts, which leads to little change in the long-run natural rate of interest."

For the average affected firm, the implied cost is $900 per worker in new duties. We construct product-level measures of exporters' exposure to import tariff increases and estimate the impact on U.S. export growth. The most exposed products had relatively lower export growth in 2018-2019, with larger effects in 2019. The decline in export growth in 2019Q3, for example, is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff on U.S. exports of 2% for the typical product and up to 4% for products with higher than average exposure."

We also present evidence that convergence occurs faster for larger price differences. Finally, we find that rates of convergence are slower for cities farther apart. However, our estimates suggest that distance alone can only account for a small portion of the much slower convergence rates across national borders."

But in practice, after controlling for distance and other standard trade costs, the remaining gaps between importer- and exporter-reported trade vary systematically with GDP, tariffs and taxes, auditing standards, corruption, and trade agreements, suggesting that firms intentionally misreport trade data. These misreports have implications for trade agreements and domestic fiscal policy, and for empirical assessments of the efficacy of those policies."

What are the impacts of these policies, and what do they reveal about market power in international trade? We study a comprehensive system of discretionary import licenses imposed by Argentina, where we observe the universe of transaction-level requests and approval decisions between 2013 and 2015. Approvals varied across firms and products in a manner consistent with the government's trade and investment objectives, and over time to safeguard the current account. Interacting these sources of variation to construct an instrument, we estimate that stricter restrictions increased the prices paid by importers, a result that runs counter to competitive price-setting behavior. Informed by a model and a classifier-Lasso, the price and quantity responses identify\u2014for each combination of importer, narrow product, and origin\u2014which side (importer or exporter) holds market power. We find that larger importers are more likely to hold market power, and those trading with richer countries are less likely to. The market-power distribution strongly shapes the effects of quantitative restrictions and the magnitude of optimal tariffs. Import prices rose by 4% as a result of Argentina's import restrictions, but would have risen by 13% (fallen by 8%) had all foreign firms (Argentinian firms) held market power."

We take advantage of a nationwide VAT rebate policy reform in China as a natural experiment to identify the existence of these intranational barriers due to local protectionism and study the impact on exports and exporting firms. As a result of shifting tax rebate burden, the reform leads to a greater incentive of the provincial governments to block the domestic flow of non-local goods to local export intermediaries. We develop an open-economy heterogenous firm model that incorporates multiple domestic regions and multiple exporting technologies, including the intermediary sector. Consistent with the model's predictions, we find that rising local protectionism leads to a reduction in interprovincial trade, more \"inward-looking\" sourcing behavior of local intermediaries, and a reduction in manufacturing exports. Analysis using micro firm-level data further shows that private companies with greater baseline reliance on export intermediaries are more adversely affected."

Further, by adopting a new textual analysis approach to listed firms' annual reports, we develop trade policy uncertainty (TPU) measures that vary over firms and time.  Our difference-in-differences examination of these firm-level data reveals that trade war increases in U.S. tariffs and Chinese retaliatory tariffs both raised Chinese firms\u2019 TPU.  The impact of tariffs on uncertainty is heterogeneous, and is most pronounced for smaller and less capital-intensive firms.  This effect is also smaller for Chinese exporters that were more diversified in terms of partner countries.  In the second stage of our analysis we explore and document the negative connection between Chinese firm-level increases in TPU and subsequent firm performance.  Our estimates indicate that Chinese firms hit by a one standard deviation increase in TPU during the trade war reduced firm-level investment, R&D expenditures, and profits by 1.4, 2.7, and 8.9 percent, respectively."

    "full_abstract": "This survey reviews the broad changes in U.S. trade policy over the course of the nation\u2019s history. Import tariffs have been the main instrument of trade policy and have had three main purposes: to raise revenue for the government, to restrict imports and protect domestic producers from foreign competition, and to reach reciprocity agreements that reduce trade barriers. These three objectives \u2013 revenue, restriction, and reciprocity \u2013 accord with three consecutive periods in history when one of them was predominant. The political economy of these tariffs has been driven by the interaction between political and economic geography, namely, the location of trade-related economic interests in different regions and the political power of those regions in Congress. The paper also addresses the impact of trade policies on the U.S. economy, such as the welfare costs of tariffs, the role of protectionism in fostering American industrialization, and the relationship between the Smoot-Hawley tariff and the Great Depression of the 1930s."

Yet neoclassical trade theory \u2013 and modern Ricardian trade models, in particular \u2013 predict that welfare-maximizing tariffs are uniform across sectors. We show that tariff escalation can be rationalized on efficiency grounds in the presence of scale economies. When both downstream and upstream sectors produce under increasing returns to scale, a unilateral tariff in either sector boosts the size and productivity of that sector, raising welfare. While these forces are reinforced up the chain for final-good tariffs, input tariffs may drive final-good producers to relocate abroad, mitigating their potential productivity benefits. The welfare benefits of final-good tariffs thus tend to be larger, with the optimal degree of tariff escalation increasing in the extent of downstream returns to scale. A quantitative evaluation of the US-China trade war demonstrates that any welfare gains from the increase in US tariffs are overwhelmingly driven by final-good tariffs."

The static deadweight welfare loss from the U.S. tariff structure is about one percent of GDP after the Civil War, but falls almost continuously thereafter to less than one-tenth of one percent of GDP by the early 1960s.  On average, import duties resulted in a welfare loss of 40 cents for every dollar of revenue generated, slightly higher than contemporary estimates of the marginal welfare cost of taxation."

To address this old question, we observe that (i) with similar or higher levels of educational attainment, trapped countries tend to have much poorer health conditions compared to the initially poor countries that later took off, and (ii) improving health conditions in poor countries usually involves large-scale investment where such resources can be easily misallocated. We construct a dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous health and knowledge accumulation, allowing health-related institutional barriers to affect individual incentives and equilibrium outcomes. We then calibrate the model to fit (i) the U.S. economy (as a benchmark), (ii) a representative trapped economy based on the average economic performance and economic conditions of 41 countries that are still in the poverty trap, (iii) a group of trapped economies with richer institutional data (Bangladesh, Kenya and Nigeria), and (iv) two initially poor countries that later took off (China and India). The results show that, although low among all countries in this study, the U.S. economy still faced a health-related institutional barrier of 15%. The trapped economies all suffered much large barriers ranging from 50% to 73% under which the incentive to invest in health is severely hindered. For China and India, the magnitudes of such barriers were large (about twice as much as for the U.S. and half that for the trapped economies on average) but not enough to undermine the willingness to invest in health. This paper thereby advances our understanding of the role played by barriers to health in the poverty trap."

Our model features cross-country heterogeneity in fundamental risk, a demand system for international assets, and frictions that cause segmentation in international capital markets. We measure frictions affecting international investment and apply our model to data from nearly 100 countries, using a new dataset of international capital taxes and cultural, geographic and linguistic distances between countries (geopoliticaldistance.org). Our model performs well in reproducing the composition of international portfolios, the cross-section of home bias and rates of return to capital, and other key features of international capital markets. Finally, we carry out counterfactual exercises: we show that barriers to international investment reduce world output by almost 7% and account for nearly half of the observed cross-country differences in capital stock per employee."

Our model combines a standard international model of fiscal policy with taxes and a dynamic model of trade participation and tariffs that allows for uncertainty and transitions. We consider effects of permanent and temporary tariffs\u2013with and without retaliation\u2013when tariff revenue is used to reduce taxes on capital or labor or to subsidize investment. Compared to a lump sum redistribution, using tariff revenue for these reforms always boosts economic activity. Key to our analysis is the effect of trade dynamics on import substitution, such that tariff revenue after an increase in tariffs is higher in the short run than in the long run. When increasing the tariff by 20 percentage points, the revenue raised is largest when tariffs are temporary, unilateral, and used to subsidize investment, increasing by about 2 percent of GDP. This case also yields a large temporary increase in the trade balance. We find the welfare-maximizing unilateral tariff is close to 18 percent when tariff revenue is used to subsidize investment compared to 0 percent under a lump sum redistribution. We also find cutting capital taxes does not generate as much growth as introducing an investment subsidy since tariffs raise the price of investment substantially."

We start by documenting that the tariffs were almost fully passed through to total prices paid by importers, suggesting that incidence has fallen largely on the United States. Since we estimate the response of prices to exchange rates to be far more muted, the recent depreciation of China\u2019s renminbi is unlikely to alter this conclusion. Next, using product-level data from several large retailers, we demonstrate that the tariffs\u2019 impact on retail prices is more mixed. Some affected product categories have seen sharp price increases, but the difference between affected and unaffected products is generally quite modest, suggesting that retail margins have fallen. These retailers' imports increased after the initial announcement of possible tariffs, but before their full implementation, so the intermediate passthrough of tariffs to their prices may not persist. Finally, in contrast to the case of foreign exporters facing US tariffs, we show that US exporters lowered their prices on goods subjected to foreign retaliatory tariffs compared to exports of non-targeted goods."

Gold standard countries chose to maintain their fixed exchange rate and reduce spending on imports rather than allow their currency to depreciate. Trade protection in the 1930s was less an instance of special interest politics than second-best macroeconomic policy when monetary and fiscal policies were constrained."

For the United States, the adjustment process has been difficult. Government and business leaders have gradually adopted the view that unfair foreign trading practices are the main cause of the country's competitive problems. By focussing on a more vigorous enforcement of US. statutes and GATT rules on fair trade, they are able to press for import protection and still maintain that they support the type of open trading regime the United States did so much to establish after World War II. While it is possible that particular protectionism will continue to spread and lead to an essentially closed international trading order, a more sanguine outcome, supported of the three major trading powers, seems possible. This is the emergence of a regime characterized by more trade-distorting government interventions than at the height of American hegemonic influence and by the existence of a significant group of industries receiving government assistance. However, while new industries will be added to this group, assistance will be withdrawn from others as they lose political influence so that on balance the list need not increase over time or, if it does, only very slowly. Such a regime will not yield the growth and efficiency benefits of an open trading system, but at least itwill not lead to the disastrous economic and political consequences brought about by the trading order that prevailed in the 1930's."

We examine this question in the context of India's 1991 tariff reforms. Overall, in the 1990s, rural India experienced a dramatic increase in schooling and decline in child labor. However, communities that relied heavily on employment in protected industries before liberalization do not experience as large an increase in schooling or decline in child labor. The data suggest that this failure to follow the national trend of increasing schooling and diminishing work is associated with a failure to follow the national trend in poverty reduction. Schooling costs appear to play a large role in this relationship between poverty, schooling, and child labor. Extrapolating from our results, our estimates imply that roughly half of India's rise in schooling and a third of the fall in child labor during the 1990s can be explained by falling poverty and therefore improved capacity to afford schooling."

In this paper, we argue that part of this apparent speed-up actually represents gains in the terms of trade and tariff reductions, especially for information-technology products. We demonstrate how unmeasured gains in the terms of trade and declines in tariffs can cause conventionally measured growth in real output and productivity to be overstated. Building on the GDP function approach of Diewert and Morrison, we develop methods for measuring these effects. From 1995 through 2006, the average growth rates of our alternative price indexes for U.S. imports are 1.5% per year lower than the growth rate of price indexes calculated using official methods. Thus properly measured terms-of-trade gain can account for close to 0.2 percentage points per year, or about 20%, of the 1995-2006 apparent increase in productivity growth for the U.S. economy.  Bias in the price indexes used to deflate domestic output is a question beyond the scope of this paper, but if upward bias were also present in those indexes, this could offset some of the effects of mismeasurement of gains in terms of trade."

We find substantial barriers to LFP, and higher costs of expanding businesses through the hiring of workers for women entrepreneurs. However, there is one area in which female entrepreneurs have an advantage: the hiring of female workers. We show that this is not driven by the sectoral composition of female employment. Consistent with this pattern, policies promoting female entrepreneurship can significantly increase female LFP even without explicitly targeting female LFP. Counterfactual simulations indicate that removing all excess barriers faced by women entrepreneurs would substantially increase the fraction of female-owned firms, female LFP, earnings, and generate substantial gains for the economy. These gains are due to higher LFP, higher real wages and profits, and reallocation: low productivity male-owned firms previously sheltered from female competition are replaced by higher productivity female-owned firms previously excluded from the economy."

A distinct feature of such MNCs is a three-tier hierarchy: foreign managers (FMs) supervise domestic managers (DMs) who supervise production workers. Tailored surveys from our setting \u2013 MNCs in Myanmar \u2013 reveal that language barriers impede interactions between FMs and DMs. A first experimental protocol offers DMs free English courses and confirms that lowering communications costs increases their interactions with FMs. A second experimental protocol that asks human-resource managers at domestic firms to rate hypothetical resumes reveals that multinational experience and, specifically, DM-FM interactions are valued in the domestic labor market. Together, these results suggest that reducing language barriers can improve transfers of management knowledge, an interpretation supported by improvements in soft skills among treatment DMs in the first experiment. A model in which communication within MNCs is non-contractible \u2013 a realistic feature of workplace life \u2013 reveals that the experimental results are consistent with underinvestment in language training and provide a rationale for policy intervention."

We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations.  Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations.  Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements.  We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers.  Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States."

This is a surprising fact given that this region has been said to have exploited globalization forces better than most during the pre-1914 belle epoque and for which the Great Depression has always been viewed as a critical policy turning point towards protection and de-linking from the world economy. This paper shows that the explanation cannot lie with output gains from protection, since, while such gains were present in Europe and its non-Latin offshoots, they were not present in Latin America. The paper then explores Latin American tariffs as a revenue source, as a protective device for special interests, and as the result of other political economy struggles. We conclude by asking whether the same pro-protection conditions exist today as those which existed more than a century ago."

We find that the most exposed products had lower exports in 2018-2019, with most of the impact occurring in 2019."

We consider a model of politically-optimal trade policy for a large country that can influence its terms of trade and where workers and firms lobby for protection. The predictions of the model hinge on import demand and export supply elasticities, which we estimate using detailed U.S. import data from 1927-35, as well as industry lobbying data. We find that tariff levels are largely determined by firm lobbies, but about about 5 percentage points of the tariffs are explained by terms of trade considerations. Decomposing the politically-optimal tariff in 1931 reveals an intensification of demand for protection by workers in the Smoot-Hawley tariff."

The model is completely real, and considers a small open economy that produces and consumes three goods each period. The model is also used to analyze the way in which the current account responds to several shocks. The working of the model is illustrated for the case of two disturbances: the imposition of import tariffs, and external terms of trade shocks. In the case of import tariffs, a distinction is made between temporary, anticipated, and permanent changes. It is shown that, without imposing rigidities or adjustment costs, interesting paths for the equilibrium real exchange rate can be generated. In particular \"overshooting\" and movements in opposite directions in periods one and two can be observed. Precise conditions under which temporary import tariffs will improve the current account are derived. Finally, several ways in which the model can be extended to take into account other issues such as changes in the fiscal deficit, and financial deregulation are discussed in detail."

It reports a set of world tariff facts for the 150 years between 1789 and 1938 that have not been well appreciated. First, tariff rates varied enormously around the globe with high tariff regions including the United States, Latin America, and industrially-lagging Europe, and the low tariff regions including Asia and the European industrial leaders. Second, while tariff rates rose on the European continent after the 1870s, they rose far more steeply and earlier in Latin America and industrially-lagging Europe, and more steeply even in Asia. Furthermore, after world tariff rates rose between 1865 and 1900, they then fell by half between 1900 and 1920, before tripling between 1920 and 1934. The most popular explanations for these world tariff facts come from two sources: Stolper-Samuelson -- scarce factors should lobby for protection when exposed to more intense world competition, and scarce factors should win the political battle if their votes carry heavy weight; and national industrial policy -- since late 20th century ISI policies must surely have their roots in the 19th century infant industry arguments. Looking at the same history that Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin did to produce their famous theorem, or that Alexander Hamilton and Frederick List did to produce their equally famous infant industry argument, I find that latter is pretty much irrelevant until the 20th century, while the former starts playing an important role a little earlier when global forces open up in the 19th century. Throughout the 150 years, tariff policy was driven consistently (and often more importantly) by revenue needs and strategic tariff behavior. Geography, home market size, world economic environment, trading partner behavior, gunboats and tariff autonomy all mattered. So did Stolper-Samuelson."

The results can help explain current differences in total factor productivity and income per capita across countries."

We demonstrate that the notion that the mere international tax differetials are a key factor behind the direction and magnitude of FDI flows is too simple. We argue that the source country tax rate works primarely on the selection process, whereas the host-country tax rate affect mainly the magnitude of the FDI, once they occur. We analyze international panel data with 24 OECD countries over the period 1981-1998 by the Heckman selection method to bring evidence in support of this argument."

Among white women, we consistently find a negative correlation between weight and labor market outcomes such as employment, hours worked, and earnings. Among African American women, weight is not correlated with employment, hours worked, or earnings, but it is correlated with the percentage of months spent on welfare between interviews. We provide suggestive evidence that these differences between white and African-American women in the relationship between body weight and labor market outcomes are partly due to differential weight-based discrimination in employment."

This study documents the presence of local protectionism and quantifies its impacts on market competition and social welfare in the context of China\u2019s automobile market. This market exhibits a salient feature that vehicle models by joint ventures (JVs) and especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs) command much higher market shares in their headquarter province than at the national level. Through spatial discontinuity analysis at provincial borders, falsification tests, and consumer surveys, we first confirm protective policies such as subsidies to local brands as the primary contributing factor. We then set up and estimate a market equilibrium model to quantify the impact of local protection, controlling for other demand and supply factors. Counterfactual simulations show that local protection leads to significant choice distortions, resulting in 18.7 billion yuan of consumer welfare loss, amounting to 40% of total subsidy. Provincial governments face a prisoner\u2019s dilemma: according to our estimates, local protection reduces aggregate social welfare, but the provincial governments have no incentive to unilaterally remove local protection."

    "full_abstract": "We show that judicial independence can reduce local protectionism and foster cross-regional economic integration. We exploit a judicial independence reform in China with staggered roll-out since 2014. The reform removed local governments\u2019 control over local courts\u2019 financial and personnel decisions, thereby substantially improving local courts\u2019 independence. Combining novel data on the universes of civil lawsuits and business registration records, we show that local defendants\u2019 rate of winning court cases against non-local plaintiffs declined by 7.0% after the reform. The effect is mainly driven by improvements in the quality of judicial decisions and is more salient for politically connected local defendants. Over time, the reduction in local protectionism encouraged smaller non-local firms to file lawsuits against larger local firms. Using the shareholding network extracted from business registration records, we find that the decline in local protectionism could attract 8.4% more inward investment flows into reformed localities. This has the potential to increase China\u2019s GDP by 2.3% when the judicial independence reform is implemented nationwide."

Embodied carbon tariffs tax the direct and indirect carbon emissions embodied in imported goods. The appeal seems obvious: as OECD countries are, on average, large net importers of embodied emissions from non-OECD countries, carbon tariffs could substantially extend the reach of OECD climate policies. We investigate this claim by simulating the effects of embodied carbon tariffs with a computable general equilibrium model of global trade and energy use. We find that embodied carbon tariffs do effectively reduce carbon leakage. However, the scope for improvements in the global cost-effectiveness of unilateral climate policy is limited. The main welfare effect of the tariffs is to shift the burden of OECD climate policy to the developing world."

We present sufficient conditions for a class of linear rules that guarantee welfare-improving tariff reform.

This fiscal switch has important implications for the US tax system. While maintaining tariff rates at summer 2025 levels would generate large government revenues, such broad tariffs have significant downsides: Efficiency losses would approach one-third of revenues raised, the tax system would be less progressive, and there would be serious tax administration concerns. The fiscal shift also has significant macroeconomic implications, although probably not the intended ones. Broad tariffs generate a large negative supply shock, simultaneously raising prices and reducing macroeconomic activity."

This paper strives to partly redress this lacuna on the theory side by introducing three novel political economy mechanisms with particular emphasis is on the role of production unbundling. One mechanism studies how lowering frictional barriers to imported parts can destroy the correlation of interests between parts producers and their downstream customers. A second mechanism studies how Kojima's pro-trade FDI raises the political economy cost of maintaining high upstream barriers. The third works via a general equilibrium channel whereby developing country's participation in the supply chains of advanced-nation industries undermines their own competitiveness in final goods, thus making final good protection more politically costly. In essence, developing nations' pursuit of the export-processing industrialisation undermines their infant-industry industrialisation strategies."

Tariff increases also result in more unemployment, higher inequality, and real exchange rate appreciation, but only small effects on the trade balance.  The effects on output and productivity tend to be magnified when tariffs rise during expansions, for advanced economies, and when tariffs go up, not down.  Our results are robust to a large number of perturbations to our methodology, and we complement our analysis with industry-level data."

The analysis uses the simplest possible partial equilibrium framework, with one small open economy and a global pollution externality. It relies on graphs of supply and demand, rather than equations or formulas, hoping to reach readers familiar with basic economics. Despite its simplicity, the framework imparts numerous lessons. (1) Absent a domestic price on carbon, a carbon tariff imposes the same costs on domestic consumers as a domestic carbon price, but a carbon tariff also subsidizes domestic pollution. (2) If one small country imposes a carbon tariff, with or without a domestic carbon tax, the economic incidence of the tariff falls on its consumers. (3) If a holdout country joins the rest of the world by enacting its own carbon regulation and consequently imports more from other countries, those increased imports are not \u201cleakage.\u201d They are the cessation of leakage from when the holdout country\u2019s policy was lax. And (4) if other countries do not appropriately regulate emissions, no single small country can use a combination of carbon taxes and carbon tariffs to fully correct the problem caused by its consumers or producers."

We find that temporary tariffs cause a recession whenever the import elasticity is below an openness-weighted average of the export elasticity and the intertemporal substitution elasticity. We argue this condition is likely satisfied in practice because durable goods generate great scope for intertemporal substitution, and because it is easier to lose competitiveness on the global market than to substitute between home and foreign goods. Unilateral tariffs do tend to improve the trade balance, but when other countries retaliate the trade balance worsens and the recession deepens. Taking into account the recessionary effect of tariffs dramatically brings down the optimal unilateral tariff level derived in standard trade theory."

Despite the centrality of the optimal tariff argument in trade policy, there exists no evidence about whether countries actually exploit their market power in trade by setting higher tariffs on goods that are supplied inelastically. We estimate disaggregate foreign export supply elasticities and find evidence that countries that are not members of the World Trade Organization systematically set higher tariffs on goods that are supplied inelastically. The typical country in our sample sets tariffs 9 percentage points higher in goods with high market power relative to those with low market power. This large effect is of a magnitude similar to the average tariffs in the data and market power explains more of the tariff variation than a commonly used political economy variable. The result is robust to the inclusion of other determinants of tariffs and a variety of model specifications. We also find that U.S. trade restrictions that are not covered by the WTO are significantly higher in goods where the U.S. has more market power. In short, we find strong evidence that these importers have market power and use it in setting non-cooperative trade policy."

We study these questions in an environment which allows for long-run bilateral and aggregate trade deficits that reflect the country\u2019s net foreign asset position and differential returns on foreign assets and liabilities (the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d). Only in special cases does the optimal tariff emerge as an increasing function of a trade deficit and for reasons unrelated to trade competitiveness. Instead, the planner trades off the conventional benefits of improved terms of trade with the costs from negative valuation effects on the country\u2019s gross financial position. In our model calibrated to the United States, its large external dollar liabilities reduce the optimal tariff three-fold, from 34% to 9%, and act as an effective hedge for its trade partners against a trade war. In contrast to the expenditure switching logic and Lerner symmetry, closing the trade imbalance calls for an appreciation of the dollar to a level that depends solely on the US external financial position, and not on trade shares or trade elasticities, and can be achieved by means of an import tariff or an export subsidy. Alternatively, financial and trade rebalancing may happen if a tariff war results in the loss of privilege and the associated dollar depreciation."

In my application, I estimate a model of demand, supply and trade policy in the automobile sector in Argentina and Brazil during 1996-1999.I measure the economic impact of a trade balance constraint that was in effect during that period and I compute predicted economic outcomes for the full adoption of a customs union, as has been agreed as part of the Mercosur negotiations, separating the sometimes opposing impacts of the removal of non-tariff barriers and the adoption of a common external tariff. Results show that the elimination of non-tariff barriers dominates the leveling of tariffs. Imports from outside of Mercosur increase under the new regime even though tariffs against these goods become more discriminatory, and exports from Brazil to Argentina decrease once the trade balance constraint is removed."

Accounting for these factors yields more plausible estimates of income elasticities, as well as smaller prediction errors."

Further-more, canceling an expected decline in future trade barriers raises investment and output in the short run but substantially lowers medium-run growth. These effects are larger when the expected reform is bigger. In the data, we find that countries with more trade growth after the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rounds decreased investment and hours worked in the years leading to the tariff cuts, as predicted by our model."

Combining several unique data sets, we test our model predictions in the context of government procurement allocation and firms' equity investment across Chinese cities.  We find that, first, when local politicians are in more intensive political competition, they allocate less government procurement contracts to firms in the competing city; second, local firms, especially local SOEs, internalize the local politicians\u2019 career concerns and invest less in the competing cities.

Coal states have enacted policies to encourage local power plants to purchase from within state mines.  We document that power plants in states and counties with substantial mining activity are more likely to be coal fired and to purchase more within political boundary coal. These results are robust to including flexible controls for the distance from power plants to mines.   While coal states benefits from local protectionism, these efforts impose social costs because coal mining and coal burning creates significant environmental consequences. We quantify these effects and find that a one-percentage point increase in the proportion of coal plants in a NERC region with an in-state coal mine results in approximately 2.3 million additional annual tons of CO2 emissions."

    "full_abstract": "This paper investigates stock performance in emerging markets in relation to their accessibility by foreign investors (as measured by the investability index of the IFC).  Using the Stehle (1977) model, we reject for most markets integration and fail to reject for all segmentation.  We find that there is a positive relationship between a stock's P/E-ratio and its investability index for most emerging markets, suggesting that barriers to access by foreigners have a negative impact.  For four markets, this result is robust to the inclusion of the world beta and the degree of international spanning of the domestic market.  A significant negative relationship between the investability index and stock return is only found for Jordan. This is likely because the effects of changes in the degree of access over time confound the cross-sectional relationship between return and investability indexes."

We find that a commuting zone which is an additional 200km (125 miles) from the closest AI hotspot has 17% lower growth in AI jobs' share of vacancies. This is driven by distance from AI papers rather than AI patents. Distance reduces growth in AI research jobs as well as in jobs adapting AI to new industries, as evidenced by strong effects for computer and mathematical researchers, developers of software applications, and the finance and insurance industry. 20% of the effect is explained by the presence of state borders between some commuting zones and their closest hotspot. This could reflect state borders impeding migration and thus flows of tacit knowledge. Distance does not capture difficulty of in-person or remote collaboration nor knowledge and personnel flows within multi-establishment firms hiring in computer occupations."

This is the gist of the theory that we develop in the paper. For a sample of 62 OECD and Non-OECD countries over the period 1987-2000, we provide supporting evidence for the existence of such conflicting effects of productivity change on bilateral FDI flows.

Abstracting from general equilibrium effects, while tariffs account for an 8% decline in US exports to China, the SOE effect accounts for a 4% decline. This SOE effect was concentrated toward the end of 2018 and start of 2019, point at which a vast majority of products had already been targeted by tariffs. Further, the SOE effect was concentrated among agricultural goods and industrial supplies, as well as among industries located in US regions with a high share of Republican votes. We also find that US exports were rerouted to the rest of the world in response to Chinese tariffs, but not in response to reduced imports by Chinese SOEs."

We find that even a substantial increase in trade tariffs and protectionism would not change the dollar\u2019s dominant role. However, policies directly supporting the yuan\u2019s international use could end the dollar\u2019s dominance if implemented for more than a decade.

Recent tariff changes have impacted a wider cross-section of goods than was true in the previous tariff round, targeting final consumption goods in addition to materials such as aluminum and steel. This paper studies the optimal monetary stabilization of tariffs using a New Keynesian model enriched with comparative advantage between multiple traded sectors that differ in terms of tariff exposure as well as market structure and price rigidity. We find that, in the aggregate, the optimal monetary response is expansionary, supporting activity and producer prices at the cost of tolerating short-run headline inflation \u2013 both in response to tariffs aimed at differentiated consumption goods and to tariffs on non-differentiated goods. The output and export dynamics arising from tariffs on each sector differ sharply, as do the motivations for an expansionary monetary response. Sectoral reallocation is an order of magnitude larger than predicted by standard macro models featuring one tradable and one nontradable sector."

The results strongly support the hypothesis that tariff-jumping is only a realistic option for multinational firms from industrialized countries.   Because many firms subject to U.S. AD investigations and eventual duties do not have these characteristics, tariff-jumping of U.S. AD protection is relatively modest.  It may also explain why developing countries have been more concerned about addressing AD protection in the WTO than industrialized countries.  While the raw numbers show a high tariff-response rate for Japanese firms, this is due almost solely to the fact that many of these firms have substantial multinational experience, not due to any Japanese-specific response per se.  I also find little evidence that certain U.S. Department of Commerce procedures that use information from the domestic petitioners (rather than the foreign firms) to calculate dumping margins has any impact on tariff-jumping responses."

In many realistic situations, even the policy objectives of other governments may not be known. For example, the balance of constitutional powers in the United States is often cited as a source of confusion as to objectives of U.S. trade policy. In this paper we examine the Bayesian Nash equilibria of several noncooperative tariff games with incomplete information, In the models examined, the home country has private information about whether its government is a low or high tariff type. If the foreign government is uncertain about this type in a one-shot game, its Nash equilibrium tariff will be lower (higher) than if it knew the home government were a low (high) tariff type. In two multistage games, misleading behavior by the home government is shown to be an equilibrium strategy for sufficiently high discount factors. Whether the uncertainty is persistent or can be resolved is shown to be important for welfare results in the multistage setting. In the models examined, tariff rules do not necessarily dominate discretionary policy."

Intertemporal export supply elasticities and relative tariff revenue weights are sufficient statistics for the optimal tariff that decentralizes the efficient allocation. We also develop a general theory of second-best optimal tariffs. In dynamic HA incomplete markets economies, Ramsey optimal tariffs trade off intertemporal terms of trade manipulation against production efficiency, risk-sharing, and redistribution. Intertemporal export supply elasticities and relative tariff revenue weights remain sufficient statistics for the intertemporal terms of trade manipulation motive of second-best optimal tariffs. We apply our results to a quantitative heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model with trade."

We examine the optimal design of tariffs in a world where large countries care not only about economic welfare but also about the political allegiance of smaller states. We consider both a unipolar setting, where a single hegemon uses preferential trade agreements to attract partners, and a bipolar world, where two great powers compete for influence. In both scenarios, we derive optimal tariffs that balance terms-of-trade considerations with strategic incentives to encourage political alignment. We find that when geopolitical concerns are active, the optimal tariff exceeds the classic Mill-Bickerdike level. In a bipolar world, optimal tariffs reflect both economic and political rivalry, and may be strategic complements or substitutes. A calibration exercise using U.N. voting patterns, an estimate of the cost of buying votes in the U.N., and military spending suggests that geopolitical motives can significantly amplify protectionist pressures and that the emergence of a second great power can contribute to a retreat from globalization."

We assume that weak multilateral enforcement mechanisms prevent governments from implementing efficient trade policies through a multilateral agreement requiring tariffs to conform to the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle.  We then ask whether ex- ceptions from MFN for the purpose of forming preferential agreements can lead to lower external tariffs, and thereby to a more efficient tariff structure under the multilateral agreement.  We identify 3 opposing effects of prefer- ential agreements on the multilateral tariff structure in this setting.  The tariff complementarity effect works to reduce the desired external tariffs of countries that join together in a preferential agreement.  Two additional effects of preferential agreements arise only when enforcement issues at the multilateral level are considered.  One of these, the punishment effect, weakens the ability of the member countries of a preferential agreement to punish deviations from the multilateral agreement thereby interfering with the ability of countries to sustain low tariffs under the multilateral agreement. The tariff discrimination effect lets countries to discriminate against those who would external tariffs of countries that join together in a preferential agreement. The relative strengths of these 3 effects determine the impact of a prefer- ential agreement on the tariff structure under the multilateral agreement. Our findings suggest that preferential agreements can have their most desirable effects on the multilateral system when the degree of multilateral cooperation is low."

By combining confidential transaction prices with foreign suppliers and U.S. distributors as well as retail prices, we trace price impacts along the supply chain, from foreign producers to U.S. consumers. Although pass-through at the border was incomplete, our estimates indicate that U.S. consumers paid more than the government received in tariff revenue, because domestic markups amplified downstream price effects. The dollar margins per bottle for the importer contracted, but expanded for distributors/retailers. Price effects emerge gradually along the chain, taking roughly one year to materialize at the retail level. Additionally, we find evidence of tariff engineering by the wine industry to avoid duties, leading to composition-driven biases in unit values in standard trade statistics."

We find little evidence that open trade policies--in the sense of lower tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade--are significantly associated with economic growth."

We use an extended version of the Judd-Grossman-Helpman model of dynamic monopolistic competition to show that an economy that inherits a small range of specialized inputs can be trapped into a lower stage of development. The limited availability of specialized inputs forces the final goods producers to use a labor intensive technology, which in turns implies a small inducement to introduce new intermediate products. The start-up costs, which make the intermediate goods producers subject to dynamic increasing returns, and pecuniary externalities that result from the factor substitution in the final goods sector, play essential roles in the model."

One potential explanation for this pattern is that families prefer such neighborhoods for other reasons, such as affordability or proximity to family and jobs. An alternative explanation is that they do not move to high-opportunity areas because of a lack of information or barriers that prevent them from making such moves. We test between these explanations using a two- phase randomized controlled trial with housing voucher recipients in Seattle and King County. We first provided a bundle of resources to facilitate moves to high-upward-mobility neighborhoods: information about high-opportunity areas, short-term financial assistance, customized assistance during the housing search process, and connections to landlords. This bundled intervention increased the fraction of families who moved to high-upward-mobility areas from 15% in the control group to 53% in the treatment group. To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, we ran a second phase with three arms: (1) information about high-opportunity areas and financial assistance only; (2) reduced support services in addition to information and financial assistance; and (3) full support services, as in the original bundled intervention. The full services had five times as large a treatment effect as the information and financial incentives treatment and three times as large an effect as the reduced support intervention, showing that high-intensity, customized support enables moves to opportunity. Interviews with randomly selected families reveal that the program succeeded by relaxing families' bandwidth constraints and addressing their specific needs, from identifying suitable units to providing emotional support to brokering with landlords. Families induced to move to higher opportunity areas tend to stay in their new neighborhoods in subsequent years and report higher levels of neighborhood satisfaction after moving. Our findings imply that many low-income families do not have a strong preference to stay in low-opportunity areas and that barriers in the housing search process are a central driver of residential segregation by income."

Our review is distinctive in three respects. First, in addition to the literature on financial aid, we examine the evidence on informational and behavioral interventions, academic programs, and affirmative action policies intended to improve college access. Second, we incorporate a wealth of recent research not included in prior reviews. Finally, we conceptualize college access broadly, as including not just whether but also where students attend and whether they have access to college-level courses.

However, these studies do not estimate what share of domestic product-price changes is due to trade barriers. This paper attempts to address this issue by analyzing not the sector bias of price changes but rather the sector bias of price changes induced by changes in U.S. tariffs and transportation costs. We find that in both the 1970s and 1980s, level cuts in tariffs and transportation costs levels were concentrated in the unskill-intensive sectors. If pass-through of trade barriers to product prices is uniform across all sectors, then this suggests falls in tariffs and transportation costs were mandating a rise in the U.S. skill premium. But despite this suggestive evidence, we estimate that the price changes induced by tariffs or transportation costs mandated a rise in the skill premium that was mostly statistically insignificant. Thus, we do not find strong evidence that falling tariffs and transport costs, working through price changes, mandated rises in inequality."

When tariffs address other distortions, monetary policy remains expansionary, but the inflationary effects are mitigated."

We identify and evaluate three sets of reasons as to why governments may prefer tariff uniformity as a means of alleviating political motives for excessive protection. First, a free-rider effect may be conducive to less lobbying under a uniform tariff regime than under a regime in which tariffs are allowed to differ. Second, an input-price effect may dampen the enthusiasm of final-goods producers for import protection. Third, a precommitment effect may increase the cost to a future government of protecting favored sectors. None of these arguments provides an unambiguous, airtight case for tariff uniformity. The decision on uniformity has to be made on a case-by-case basis."

This paper examines the magnitude of protection given to import-competing producers and the costs imposed on export-oriented producers by focusing on changes in the domestic prices of traded goods relative to non-traded goods. Because the tariffs tended to increase the prices of non-traded goods, the degree of protection was much less than indicated by nominal rates of protection; the results here suggest that the 30 percent average tariff on imports yielded a 15 percent implicit subsidy to import-competing producers while effectively taxing exporters at a rate of 11 percent. The paper also finds that tariff policy redistributed large amounts of income (about 9 percent of GDP) across groups, although the impact on consumers was only slightly negative because they devoted a sizeable share of their expenditures to exportable goods. These findings may explain why import-competing producers pressed for even greater protection in the face of already high tariffs and why consumers (as voters) did not strongly oppose the policy."

These variables augment uncertainty measures such as global Economic Policy Uncertainty, US monetary and trade policy uncertainty, and the VIX. In addition, we investigate whether the US imposition of tariffs in 2018 had any measurable impact on dollar and other holdings. We conclude that financial sanctions and trade policy uncertainty have a statistically and economically significant effect on holdings of the US dollar. US tariffs had an economically \u2013 but not statistically \u2013 significant impact on shares of foreign exchange reserves: dollar shares fell by 2.1% and other shares rose by 0.8%.

They assign a central role to the Depression in explaining the passage of the 1930 Tariff Act and at the same time emphasize the role of the tariff in the propogation of the Depression. This paper argues that popular accounts have conveyed what is at best an incomplete and at worst a misleading impression of the relationship between the tariff and the Depression. Rather than simply strengthening the hand of a Republican Executive predisposed toward protection or increasing the burden borne by a depressed agricultural sector, the uneven impact of the Depression occasioned the birth of a new protectionist coalition comprised of producers particularly hard hit by import competition: border agriculture and small-scale industry engaged in the production of speciality goods. Rather than leading to a dramatic across-the-board decline in the volume of U.S. imports, the tariff had very different effects across sectors. Rather than worsening the Great Depression by reducing foreign demands for U.S. exports, the direct macroeconomic effect of the tariff is likely to have been expansionary. This remains true even when feedbacks to the United States and foreign retaliation are analyzed. In any case, relative to the Depression, the direct macroeconomic effects of the tariff were small. If Smoot-Hawley had significant macroeconomic effects, these operated instead through its impact on the stability of the international monetary system and the efficiency of the international capital market."

    "full_abstract": "In the two years after the imposition of the Smoot-Hawley tariff in June 1930, the volume of U.S. imports fell over 40 percent.  To what extent can this collapse of trade be attributed to the tariff itself versus other factors such as declining income or foreign retaliation?  Partial and general equilibrium assessments indicate that the Smoot-Hawley tariff itself reduced imports by 4-8 percent (ceteris paribus), although the combination of specific duties and deflation further raised the effective tariff and reduced imports an additional 8-10 percent.  A counter-factual simulation suggests that nearly a quarter of the observed 40 percent decline in imports can be attributed to the rise in the effective tariff, (i.e., Smoot-Hawley plus deflation)."

The model predicts a relation between consumption and tariffs that differs radically from that implied by models without asset markets or political risk. Given the probability distribution of tariffs, domestic consumption and utility (ex post) are lower in states of the world with a domestic tariff and no foreign tariff than with a foreign tariff and no domestic tariff.This conclusion emerges despite the fact that the opposite would be obtained in the absence of asset markets. So economists should not be surprised if observed relations between consumption and tariffs differ from the predictions of static theory in either time-series or cross-sections."

The analysis also reveals a potential equilibrium multiplicity in which a trade war impoverishes one country while enriching its trading partner, with the identity of the winner and loser determined by a sunspot. The key adjustment mechanism is the tariff-induced shift in the terms of trade (and the corresponding real exchange rate), which revalues the relative gross asset positions to ensure that any residual trade is consistent with the inherited financial claims."

Using newly compiled historical records from the Early American Republic, we show that as Customs administration matured, the tariff code became more complex and more reliant on specific (quantity-based) tariffs in preference to ad valorem (value-based) ones.  We develop an equilibrium model of tariff administration with costly verification of declared values that explains these twin trends: Administrative capacity allows Customs officials to disaggregate goods and assess tailored specific tariffs, obviating misvaluation while minimizing price distortions.  The model successfully predicts several additional empirical patterns: Specific tariffs tend to be assessed on goods that are homogeneous, cheap, or lightly taxed."

The threat of large retaliatory tariffs and fears of a 1930s style downturn in trade have been associated with numerical trade modelling which project post retaliation optimal tariffs in excesses of 100%. In the relevant numerical modelling it is common to use the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity by country. Here we argue and show by numerical calculation that the widespread use of this assumption gives a large upward bias to optimal tariffs, both first step and post retaliation, relative to alternative homogenous good models used in trade theory."

We reaffirm Taussig's judgment that the U.S. cotton textile industry was largely independent of the tariff by the 1830s.  American and British producers specialized in quite different types of textile products that were poor substitutes for one another.  The Walker tariff of 1846, for example, reduced the duties on cotton textiles from nearly 70 percent to 25 percent and imports soared as a result, but there was little change in domestic production.  Using data from 1826 to 1860, we estimate the responsiveness of domestic production to fluctuations in import prices and conclude that the industry could have survived even if the tariff had been completely eliminated."

It uses a fairly general model based on the work of Spence and Sheshinski. A crucial determinant of the direction of these effects is shown to be the valuation of increments in quality by marginal consumers,relative to that of all consumers on average. A way of comparing infinitesimal equivalent policies is developed and used to compare import equivalent policies. For reasonable characterizations of demand - tariffs are shown to dominate quotas on the basis of their revenue effects alone, while quotas are shown to dominate tariffs on the basis of their quality effects alone. Also, quality controls are shown to dominate both tariffs and quotas on the basis of revenue effects alone for reasonable characterizations of demand. Some special cases are also analyzed, including the case where demand is modelled along the lines of Swan - and only services of the good produced matter to consumers."

We study both a unilateral 10pp tariff increase and a global trade war scenario with retalia- tory tariffs of a similar magnitude. In either case, tariffs are always sharply contractionary for US GDP, increasing inflation and widening the trade deficit. Measured in welfare terms a unilateral tariff generates gains for the US due to a large terms of trade appreciation, but these US welfare gains vanish with global retaliation. Three features of the model are critical in the evaluation of the tariff impact - the asymmetry in size and openness between the US and the rest of the world, the endogenous response of monetary policy to the inflationary effects of tariffs, and the importance of trade in intermediate goods for the scale of the global response to a tariff shock."

Recently however, there hasbeen a sharp shift towards unilateral, discretionary trade policy focused on short term macroeconomic objectives, and as a consequence, the use of trade policy has become entangled with that of monetary policy.  This paper explores the consequences of this shift within a standard DSGE open economy macroeconomic model. We find that a discretionary non-cooperative approach to trade policy can significantly worsen macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, the stance of monetary policy has major implications for the degree of protection in a non-cooperative equilibrium.  In particular, cooperative determination of monetary policy implies an increase in both equilibrium tariffs and inflation, and a significant fall in welfare.  By contrast, when the exchange rate is pegged by one country, equilibrium rates of protection are generally lower, but in this case, there are multiple asymmetric equilibria in tariff rates which benefit one country relative to another.  We also explore the determination of non-cooperative tariffs in a situation where monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates."

    "full_abstract": "In theory, we should expect tariffs to be partially offset by a currency appreciation in the tariff-imposing country or by a depreciation in the country on which the tariff is imposed. We find, based on a calibrated model, that the tariffs imposed by the US in 2018-19 should not have had a large impact on the dollar but may have significantly depreciated the renminbi. This prediction is consistent with a high-frequency event analysis looking at the impact of tariff-related news on the dollar and the renminbi. We find that tariffs explained at most one fifth of the dollar effective appreciation but around two thirds of the renminbi effective depreciation observed in 2018-19."

We embed a multi-sector model of trade between multiple countries into a model of inter-connected bilateral negotiations over tariffs. Using 1990 trade flows and tariff outcomes from the Uruguay Round of GATT/WTO negotiations, we estimate country-sector productivity levels, sector-level productivity dispersion, iceberg trade costs, and country-pair bargaining parameters. We use the estimated model to simulate an alternative institutional setting for multilateral tariff negotiations in which the most-favored-nation requirement is abandoned. We find that abandonment of the most-favored-nation requirement would result in inefficient over-liberalization of tariffs and a deterioration in world-wide welfare relative to the negotiated outcomes in the presence of the most-favored-nation requirement."

We consider \"weak-rules\" settings characterized by two cases: a no-rules case in which discriminatory tariffs are allowed, and an MFN-only case in which negotiated tariffs must be non-discriminatory (i.e., satisfy the MFN rule). We allow for a general family of political-economic country welfare functions and assess efficiency relative to these welfare functions. For the no-rules case with discriminatory tariffs, we consider simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations and utilize the \"Nash-in-Nash\" solution concept of Horn and Wolinsky (1988). We establish a sense in which the resulting tariffs are inefficient and too low, so that excessive liberalization occurs from the perspective of the three countries. In the MFN-only case, we consider negotiations between two countries that are \"principal suppliers\" to each other and employ the Nash bargaining solution concept. Different possibilities arise. For one important situation, we establish a sense in which the resulting tariffs are inefficient and too high when evaluated relative to the unrestricted set of efficient tariffs. We also compare the negotiated tariffs under the MFN rule with the MFN-constrained efficiency frontier, finding that the negotiated tariffs are generically inefficient relative to this frontier and may lead to too little or too much liberalization. Finally, we illustrate our findings with a numerical analysis of a particular representation of the model as an endowment economy with Cobb-Douglas preferences and under the assumption that each government maximizes the indirect utility of the representative agent in its country."

However, prosumers serve their own interests and their objectives are unlikely to align with that of society. This paper develops a bilevel model to study the optimal design of retail electricity tariffs considering the balance between economic efficiency and energy equity. The retail tariff entails a fixed charge and a volumetric charge tied to electricity usage to recover utilities' fixed costs. We analyze solution properties of the bilevel problem and prove an optimal rate design, which is to use fixed charges to recover fixed costs and to balance energy equity among different income groups. This suggests that programs similar to CARE (California Alternative Rate of Energy), which offer lower retail rates to low-income households, are unlikely to be efficient, even if they are politically appealing.",

    "full_abstract": "Distributed rooftop photovoltaics (PV) is one of the pillars of the energy transition. However, the massive integration of distributed PV systems challenges the existing grid, with high amounts of PV injection possibly leading to over-voltage and reverse power flow, with line and transformer overloading, among other issues. Moreover, the increase in PV self-consumption and consequently the reduction of imported electricity poses a problem in recovering Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) grid costs, that until now have been directly linked to the amount of electricity consumed due to the volumetric nature of traditional tariffs. To investigate whether alternative tariffs could mitigate PV impacts at the distribution level without hampering PV development, we assess five electricity tariffs that could help the DSOs to recover the costs of maintaining the distribution grid. Additionally, we evaluate how such tariffs may affect private investment in storage and their impact on three types of low-voltage networks (i.e., urban, semi-urban, and rural). We found that tariffs with a capacity-based component promote further adoption of PV and storage. At the same time, they allow the DSOs to recover the grid cost without incurring relevant economic differences for the customer. However, all assessed tariffs were found to have a limited role in mitigating PV impacts at the distribution level.",

Statistical modeling (linear regression) quantifies the policy's consistent 'discounted reciprocity' pattern, which is interpreted using a Game Theory perspective on strategic interaction. Machine learning (K-Means clustering) identifies distinct country typologies based on tariff exposure and Economic Complexity Index (ECI), linking the policy to Economic Complexity theory. The study's primary application focuses on the major coffee exporting sector, utilizing simulation modeling grounded in principles of demand elasticity and substitution to project potential trade flow impacts. Specifically, for coffee, this simulation demonstrates how the proposed tariff differentials can induce significant substitution effects, projecting a potential shift in U.S. import demand away from high-tariff origins toward lower-tariff competitors. This disruption, stemming from the tariffs impacting exporting countries, is projected to ultimately increase coffee prices for consumers in the United States. Findings throughout are contextualized within Political Economy considerations. Overall, the study demonstrates how integrating regression, clustering, and simulation with economic theory exemplified through the coffee sector analysis provides a robust framework for assessing the potential systemic impacts, including consumer price effects, of strategic trade policies.",

When electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (HPs) are owned primarily by households with higher financial status than others, new tariff designs may clash with the economic argument for efficiency and the political arguments for fairness. This article combines tariff design and redistributive mechanisms to strike a balance between time-differentiated signals, revenue stability for the utility, limited grid costs for vulnerable households, and promoting electrification. We simulate the impacts of this combination on 1.4 million Danish households (about 50% of the country's population) and quantify the cross-subsidization effects between groups. With its unique level of detail, this study stresses the spillover effects of tariffs. We show that a subscription-heavy tariff associated with a ToU rate and a low redistribution factor tackles all the above goals.",

They are based on supply-demand equilibria that do not exist during recessionary shocks. Here we focus on resilience as a nonequilibrium property of networked production systems and develop a linear response theory for input-output economics. By calibrating the framework to data from 56 industrial sectors in 43 countries between 2000 and 2014, we find that the susceptibility of individual industrial sectors to economic shocks varies greatly across countries, sectors, and time. We show that susceptibility-based predictions that take sector- and country-specific recovery into account, outperform--by far--standard econometric growth-models. Our results are analytically rigorous, empirically testable, and flexible enough to address policy-relevant scenarios. We illustrate the latter by estimating the impact of recently imposed tariffs on US imports (steel and aluminum) on specific sectors across European countries.",

A further development is capacity subscription, where consumers are financially penalised for exceeding their subscribed capacity, or alternatively their demand is limited to the subscribed level.

We investigate the cost impact for static and dynamic capacity subscription tariffs, for 84 consumers based on six years of historical load data. We use several approaches for finding the optimal subscription level ex ante. The results show that annual costs remain both stable and similar for most consumers, with a few exceptions for those that have high peak demand. In the case of a physical limitation, it is important to use a stochastic approach for the optimal subscription level to avoid excessive demand limitations. Facing increased peak loads due to electrification, regulators should consider a move to capacity-based tariffs in order to reduce cross-subsidisation between consumers and increase cost reflectivity without impacting the DSO cost recovery.",

    "full_abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between grid tariffs and investment in Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) energy system, and how the grid exchanges are affected. Different grid tariffs (energy based, time of use (ToU), subscribed capacity and dynamic) are implemented in an optimization model that minimizes the cost of investing and operating a ZEN during its lifetime. The analysis is conducted in two cases: non-constrained exports and exports limited to 100kWh/h. The results suggest that in the case with no limit on export, the grid tariff has little influence, but ToU is economically advantageous for both the ZEN and the DSO. When exports are limited, the subscribed capacity scheme allows to maintain DSO revenue, while the others cut them by half. This tariff also offers the lowest maximum peak and a good duration curve. The dynamic tariff creates new potentially problematic peak imports despite its benefits in other peak hours.",

    "full_abstract": "The integration of photovoltaic systems poses several challenges for the distribution grid, mainly due to the infrastructure not being designed to handle the upstream flow and being dimensioned for consumption only, potentially leading to reliability and stability issues. This study investigates the use of capacity-based tariffs, export tariffs, and curtailment policies to reduce negative grid impacts without hampering PV deployment. We analyze the effect of such export tariffs on three typical Swiss low-voltage networks (rural, semi-urban, and urban), using power flow analysis to evaluate the power exchanges at the transformer station, as well as line overloading and voltage violations. Finally, a simple case of mutualization of resources is analyzed to assess its potential contribution to relieving network constraints and the economic costs of managing LV networks. We found that the tariff with capacity-based components on the export (CT export daily) severely penalizes PV penetration. This applies to other tariffs as well (e.g. IRR monthly, Curtailment 30, and DT variable) but to a lesser extent. However, the inclusion of curtailment at 50\\% and 70\\%, as well as mixed tariffs with capacity-based components at import and curtailment, allow for a high degree of PV installations in the three zones studied and help to mitigate the impact of PV on the distributed network.",

    "full_abstract": "Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) can significantly affect the net social benefit in power systems, raising concerns pertaining to distributive justice, equity, and fairness. Electricity tariff and DERs share a symbiotic relationship whereby the design of the former directly impacts the economic efficiency and equity in the system. Current tariff design approaches suffer from opaque efficiency-equity trade-offs and are also agnostic of the externalities that affect both economic efficiency and equity. Therefore, this paper develops a justice-cognizant tariff design framework that improves the economic efficiency of tariff without sacrificing its distributional equity, and encompasses economic welfare, social costs of environmental and public health impacts, and socio-economic and demographic characteristics of electricity consumers. The proposed framework is based on a Single Leader Single Follower (SLSF) game incorporating a multi-objective optimization problem, and is evaluated on four different tariff structures. The SLSF game is reformulated as a Multi-Objective Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPEC) and is solved by integrating the objective sum method for multi-objective optimization and Scholtes's relaxation technique for equilibrium constraints. We compare the economic efficiency and equity of the proposed framework using the 11-zone New York ISO and 7-bus Manhattan power networks. The results demonstrate that spatially- and temporally-granular tariffs ensure equity and economic efficiency at a lower energy burden to consumers.",

With increasing fixed parts of retail tariffs, optimal battery capacities and self-generation are smaller, and households contribute more to non-energy power sector costs.

Our framework captures several key features of LLMs: variable operational costs of processing input and output tokens; the ability to customize models through fine-tuning; and high-dimensional user heterogeneity in terms of task requirements and error sensitivity. In our model, a monopolistic seller offers multiple versions of LLMs through a menu of products. The optimal pricing structure depends on whether token allocation across tasks is contractible and whether users face scale constraints. Users with similar aggregate value-scale characteristics choose similar levels of fine-tuning and token consumption. The optimal mechanism can be implemented through menus of two-part tariffs, with higher markups for more intensive users. Our results rationalize observed industry practices such as tiered pricing based on model customization and usage levels.",

    "full_abstract": "With Australia's significant capacity of household PV, decreasing battery costs may lead to widespread use of household PV-battery systems. As the adoption of these systems are heavily influenced by retail tariffs, this paper analyses the effects of flat retail tariffs with households free to invest in PV battery systems. Using Perth, Australia for context, an open-source model is used to simulate household PV battery investments over a 20-year period. We find that flat usage and feed-in tariffs lead to distinct residual demand patterns as households' transition from PV-only to PV-battery systems. Analysing these patterns qualitatively from the bottom-up, we identify tipping point transitions that may challenge future electricity system management, market participation and energy policy. The continued use of flat tariffs incentivises PV-battery households to maximise self-consumption, which reduces annual grid-imports, increases annual grid-exports, and shifts residual demand towards winter. Diurnal and seasonal demand patterns continue to change as PV-battery households eventually become net-generators. Unmanaged, these bottom-up changes may complicate energy decarbonisation efforts within centralised electricity markets and suggests that policymakers should prepare for PV-battery households to play a more active role in the energy system.",

    "full_abstract": "We advance a recently flourishing line of work at the intersection of learning theory and computational economics by studying the learnability of two classes of mechanisms prominent in economics, namely menus of lotteries and two-part tariffs. The former is a family of randomized mechanisms designed for selling multiple items, known to achieve revenue beyond deterministic mechanisms, while the latter is designed for selling multiple units (copies) of a single item with applications in real-world scenarios such as car or bike-sharing services. We focus on learning high-revenue mechanisms of this form from buyer valuation data in both distributional settings, where we have access to buyers' valuation samples up-front, and the more challenging and less-studied online settings, where buyers arrive one-at-a-time and no distributional assumption is made about their values. We provide a suite of results with regard to these two families of mechanisms. We provide the first online learning algorithms for menus of lotteries and two-part tariffs with strong regret-bound guarantees. Since the space of parameters is infinite and the revenue functions have discontinuities, the known techniques do not readily apply. However, we are able to provide a reduction to online learning over a finite number of experts, in our case, a finite number of parameters. Furthermore, in the limited buyers type case, we show a reduction to online linear optimization, which allows us to obtain no-regret guarantees by presenting buyers with menus that correspond to a barycentric spanner. In addition, we provide algorithms with improved running times over prior work for the distributional settings. Finally, we demonstrate how techniques from the recent literature in data-driven algorithm design are insufficient for our studied problems.",

The study utilized both difference and system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) since the cross-sections (N) were greater than the periods (T). The study found that container port traffic, quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure have a strong influence on imports and exports of goods and national income while trade tariff hurts the growth of the countries. The study also found that most of the trade facilitation indicators indicated a weak positive influence on trade flows and economic growth. Based on these findings, the study recommends that reforms aimed at significantly lowering the costs of trading across borders among middle-income countries should be highly prioritized in policy formulations, with a focus on the export side by reducing at-the-border documentation, time, and real costs of trading across borders while the international organizations should continue to report the set of Trade Facilitation Indicators (TFIs) that identify areas for action and enable the potential impact of reforms to be assessed.",

Trade between East and West across the Iron Curtain (a symbolical and physical barrier dividing Europe into two distinct areas) was restricted, but the severity of these restrictions varied over time. We quantify the trade and welfare effects of the Iron Curtain and show how the difficulty of trading across the Iron Curtain fluctuated throughout the Cold War. Using a novel dataset on trade between the two economic blocs and a quantitative trade model, we find that while the Iron Curtain at its height represented a tariff equivalent of 48% in 1951, trade between East and West gradually became easier until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Despite the easing of trade restrictions, we estimate that the Iron Curtain roughly halved East-West trade flows and caused substantial welfare losses in the Eastern bloc countries that persisted until the end of the Cold War. Conversely, the Iron Curtain led to an increase in intra-bloc trade, especially in the Eastern bloc, which outpaced the integration of Western Europe in the run-up to the formation of the European Union.",

    "full_abstract": "Demand response (DR) programs play a crucial role in improving system reliability and mitigating price volatility by altering the core profile of electricity consumption. This paper proposes a game-theoretical model that captures the dynamic interplay between retailers (leaders) and consumers (followers) in a tariffs-based electricity market under uncertainty. The proposed procedure offers theoretical and economic insights by analyzing demand flexibility within a hierarchical decision-making framework. In particular, two main market configurations are examined under uncertainty: i) there exists a retailer that exercises market power over consumers, and ii) the retailer and the consumers participate in a perfect competitive game. The former case is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), whereas the latter case is recast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). These problems are solved by deriving equivalent tractable reformulations based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of each agent's problem.\n  Numerical simulations based on real data from the European Energy Exchange platform are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology. The results indicate that the proposed model effectively characterizes the interactions between retailers and flexible consumers in both perfect and imperfect market structures. Under perfect competition, the economic benefits extend not only to consumers but also to overall social welfare. Conversely, in an imperfect market, retailers leverage consumer flexibility to enhance their expected profits, transferring the risk of uncertainty to end-users. Additionally, the degree of consumer flexibility and their valuation of electricity consumption play significant roles in shaping market outcomes.",

    "full_abstract": "The Ricardian model of world trade based on comparative advantage is not sufficient to justify equal trade relations.The existing model of trade relations does not explain the distribution of income among trading countries. This paper presents a method for building equitable trade relations. Its essence is to present an algorithm for building such trade relations, based on the previously proposed model of world trade, that the trade balance of each country would be equal to zero. Under such conditions, tariff wars would become impossible. It is proved that, provided that the supply structure is consistent with the demand structure, it is always possible to build an equilibrium price vector for which the trade balance of each country is zero. This state of economic equilibrium is called ideal. The article presents an algorithm to build an export structure based on the structure of imports. This algorithm is quite simple and allows for a wide range of applications. Under fairly simple realistic assumptions about the behaviour of countries trading with each other that are subject to tariff restrictions, it is proved that this leads to an increase in the prices of the goods traded by these countries. Among the equilibrium states, there are also those called oversupply states. The latter describes the phenomenon of recession. This contributes to a fall in stock market indices.",

    "full_abstract": "The rapid electrification of city bus fleets offers significant environmental benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, it also introduces complex challenges in energy management and infrastructure planning for public transport operators (PTOs). This study develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to minimize daily operational costs for electric bus (EB) networks. The model integrates on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, energy storage systems (ESS), and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities, while explicitly accounting for dynamic electricity tariffs, peak demand charges, and battery degradation costs. A discrete-event optimization (DEO) scheme is employed to balance computational efficiency with operational accuracy. The framework is applied to a real-world case in Brussels involving 28 articulated electric buses (EBs) and 232 trips over a 24-hour horizon. A scenario-based analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of the extended components. Key findings show that incorporating demand charges into the optimization reduces daily costs by 5% and decreases the share of peak power costs by 9%, underlining the importance of load management. Integrating PV and ESS leads to a total net cost reduction of up to 56%, with ESS primarily used for energy arbitrage rather than direct bus charging. V2G participation is highly sensitive to battery degradation costs and policy incentives: it can become economically viable under high tariff margins and decreased replacement costs. When all extensions are combined, the model achieves a 58% reduction in total operational expenses compared to the baseline, highlighting the substantial value of smart (dis)charging optimization tools for PTOs.",

    "full_abstract": "Some consumers, particularly households, are unwilling to face volatile electricity prices, and they can perceive as unfair price differentiation in the same local area. For these reasons, nodal prices in distribution networks are rarely employed. However, the increasing availability of renewable resources and emerging price-elastic behaviours pave the way for the effective introduction of marginal nodal pricing schemes in distribution networks. The aim of the proposed framework is to show how traditional non-flexible consumers can coexist with flexible users in a local distribution area. Flexible users will pay nodal prices, whereas non-flexible consumers will be charged a fixed price derived from the underlying nodal prices. Moreover, the developed approach shows how a distribution system operator should manage the local grid by optimally determining the lines to be expanded, and the collected network tariff levied on grid users, while accounting for both congestion rent and investment costs. The proposed model is formulated as a non-linear integer bilevel program, which is then recast as an equivalent single optimization problem, by using integer algebra and complementarity relations. The power flows in the distribution area are modelled by resorting to a second-order cone relaxation, whose solution is exact for radial networks under mild assumptions. The final model results in a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program, which can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers. Numerical test cases based on both 5-bus and 33-bus networks are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The empirical literature provides contrasting and heterogeneous evidence, with some studies supporting the standards as catalysts view, and others favouring the standards as barriers explanation. To the extent that NTMs can influence trade, understanding the prevailing effect, and the motivations behind one effect or the other, is a pressing issue. We review a large body of empirical evidence on the effect of NTMs on agri-food trade and conduct a meta-analysis to disentangle potential determinants of heterogeneity in estimates. Our findings show the role played by the publication process and by study-specific assumptions. Some characteristics of the studies are correlated with positive significant estimates, others covary with negative significant estimates. Overall, we found that the effects of NTMs vary across types of NTMs, proxy for NTMs, and levels of details of studies.

    "full_abstract": "Due to the considerable distances from the major sales markets of Russia, the Far East has close ties with markets of the countries in the Asian-Pacific region (APR). The current expansion of trade and economic interactions with these countries has a positive effect on the economic development of the Far East. Reducing various barriers to trade with the APR countries can increase the scale of bilateral trade, acting as a source of growth and development for the economy of the Far East. To determine the ranges for increasing trade, the potential for trade interactions arising from the leveling of various barriers was quantified. It is shown that for the Far East a gradual change in the intensity of foreign trade relations was observed in favor of geographically close foreign markets, the Asia-Pacific countries. Based on the constructed gravity dependence, trade barriers for interactions between the Far East and Asia-Pacific countries were estimated and decomposed into the ad valorem equivalent. It was determined that the major source of tariff barriers was the tariff burden on exports and imports, formed by the Russian side. The decomposition assessment showed that the comparative institutional barriers between the Far East and the Asia-Pacific countries were significantly greater than the comparative tariff barriers. This circumstance indicated the insufficiency of reducing tariff barriers for intensifying the bilateral trade between the Far East and the Asia-Pacific countries. The analysis made it possible to assume that the introduction of various types of weakly motivated trade restrictions by the Russian side led to a shift in the customs burden from tariff barriers to institutional ones. In addition to the Republic of Korea, a general vector of intensification of trade between the Far East and the Asia-Pacific countries was observed for China. The estimates obtained suggest that the comparative institutional barriers between the Far Eastern regions and China will continue to decline. It is shown that the leveling of comparative institutional barriers between the Far East and Japan can significantly increase trade interactions between the Russian macroregion and the APR market. ",

Not only the level of regulation in home or export country matters, but also the inter-country differences in regulation for service markets. Regulatory measures tend to affect fixed costs rather than variable costs. The fact that regulations often differ by market, means that the fixed costs of complying with regulations in an export market are in fact sunk market-entry costs. Our theoretical model demonstrates that policy heterogeneity between countries has a negative impact on bilateral service trade. We quantify bilateral policy variety through a new indicator that is applied in a gravity model for explaining service trade among EU countries. The empirical results support our theoretical prediction: the degree of regulatory heterogeneity is inversely related to the level of bilateral service trade. The results are applied to simulate the possible impacts of recent EU proposals for the services market. It shows that making more use of mutual recognition in regulation could increase bilateral trade in commercial services among EU countries by 30% to 60%. ",

This paper proposes a structural approach that allows for a non-parametric relationship and treats tariff and non-tariff trade-policy variables as potentially endogenous in log-linear estimation. We document that the data reject the assumption of log-linearity of trade costs in both the tariff- and the non-tariff-policy domains. Specifically, the partial impact of a change in tariffs is strongest for low policy barriers and medium levels of tariffs but generally decreases in the level of both non-tariff barriers and tariff barriers. To give a relevant illustration, we assess the effects of a unilateral increase of US tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 percentage points and document that the estimated effects on real bilateral trade-flow changes would be largely underestimated by standard approaches.

This limits the scope of the regulation of NTBs in the existing WTO covered agreements as well as in the ASEAN Economic Community instruments including the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA). This paper tries to address that issue by resorting to the soft approach. The soft approach tool selected is the ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR). This paper analyses the electronic content of the ATR which like any regional trade portal embodies the non-tariff measures (NTMs) introduced by ASEAN Member States (AMS) and the laws, regulations and orders on which they are based. This paper finds that the success of the ATR in addressing the NTMs depends on the success of AMS\u2019 National Trade Repositories (NTRs). This paper finds that for most AMS, there is connectivity between ATR and NTRs. But there are challenges to the effective implementation of the ATR. This paper concludes by linking the analysis of the ATR to addressing the inadequacies in the regulation of NTBs in ASEAN. The ATR facilitates the identification of NTMs which should be eliminated as NTBs. ",

Using customs data on imports at the article level, we show that Canadian trade policy during this period was at least 11% more restrictive than previously understood. We compute the first estimates of the static welfare losses associated with tariff policy at this time to be 0.7-1.5% of GDP.

This paper looks at the most important challenges and opportunities for a successful model for regulatory cooperation under the Canada-EU Comprehensive Trade Agreement (CETA). It argues that the CETA will represent a compromise between the two dominant models in international trade: the EU and North American approach to regulatory cooperation in PTAs. In addition, because of the specificity of Canada\u2019s federal structure it is argued that the CETA will be able to bring about greater regulatory coherence within Canada by disciplining provincial regulation that result in NTBs.  This paper argues that while a sui generis case, in order for it to be successful, regulatory cooperation under the CETA will have to incorporate certain elements established in theory and in previous state practice. Finally, as a first comprehensive transatlantic PTA, regulatory cooperation under the CETA will in itself become a model for future such endeavors between economically developed countries, especially in its implementation aspect.

    "full_abstract": "So long as the UK government liberates itself from the protectionist mercantilist mindset of the European Union and reduces trade barriers after Brexit, and UK businesses respond positively to the challenge of increased international competition (through increased productivity and exports), the prospects for UK trade and prosperity post-Brexit are very bright indeed. The EU itself acknowledges that 90% of future growth in global gross domestic product will be outside the EU. The costs of remaining in the EU are very high and not all purely economic: the EU is no longer a force for global liberalisation. On the basis of both international and EU law, the monetary costs to the UK of leaving the EU should have been fairly low. Similarly, the frictional costs to both the UK and the EU of their post-Brexit trade relationship should also be low. However, as a consequence of both the concessions made by the UK in order to demonstrate its goodwill and the hard line taken by the EU in order to discourage other member states from leaving, these costs could well end up being much higher than they need be for both sides. Of particular concern is the EU\u2019s \u2018level playing field\u2019 demand, laid out in the (albeit non-binding) Political Declaration for a future trading relationship. This would effectively prevent the UK from achieving regulatory autonomy or from pursuing an independent trade policy. The Treasury predicts a 7.7% reduction in GDP in the event of \u2018no deal\u2019 in which the UK retained the existing Common External Tariff with the rest of the world and also imposed the same tariffs on trade with the EU. However, EU barriers on trade in food and manufactures raise their prices by 20%. If the UK leaves the Customs Union and these barriers are reduced from 20% to 10%, UK GDP would rise by 4%. The cost of meeting the excessive regulatory standards of the Single Market is equivalent to 2% of GDP. If the UK also leaves the Single Market, UK GDP would rise by 6% in total, very similar to the 5.4% increase in GDP following Australia\u2019s trade liberalisation in 1986. ",

We use the GTAP Computable General Equilibrium model and the Ad Valorem Equivalents (AVE) of NTBs in services computed using the Services Trade Restrictiveness Indices (STRI) of the World Bank database according to the methodology of the Australian Productivity Commission. Our results suggest that AfCFTA is associated with an increase in GDP and regional household income in the medium and long term for the ECOWAS and SADC regions. Moreover, the liberalization of services increases the two components in the medium and long term for the two integration areas. Bilateral exports of agricultural and manufacturing goods between the two trading blocs increase in the medium and long term. The reduction of NTBs in services is leading to an increase in bilateral exports of agricultural and manufacturing goods in the long run. South Africa remained the largest exporter of manufacturing and agricultural goods. The lowering of barriers to trade in services is leading to a considerable increase in bilateral trade in services between the two trading blocs. Moreover, this trade agreement creates a trade diversion in the long term, but the gain in welfare remains positive and significant in the long term. ",

    "full_abstract": "Since trade liberalization started in earnest in the 1990s, conventional trade barriers, such as tariffs, have been dropping steadily worldwide. Under the WTO regime, member countries are unable to impose tariff higher than set rates, and effective tariff rates have been decreasing consistently as a result. In addition, the spread of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements has accelerated this phenomenon. It follows that many governments have begun to use non-tariff measures (NTMs), such as technological measures, standards, and intellectual property rights, as strategic trade policies. The variety and volume of NTMs have increased.According to Annex 1.2 of the WTO's TBT Agreement, \"standards\" refer to \u201cdocument approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory.\u201d Standards are intended primarily to improve the compatibility and quality of products and reinforce consumer protection, but may serve as de facto trade barriers that prevent foreign corporations from entering the domestic market and protect domestic businesses, whether the domestic governments intend it or not. The U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations (FMVSS) gives a good example of using standards as trade barriers. In most countries, vehicles are produced according to international safety standards called the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which are accepted in just about every country in the world except the US and Canada. Foreign automakers, who already produce their products under UNECE and wish to export them to the U.S. and Canada, must satisfy the FMVSS and thus must modify their UNECE-compliance models. This then creates additional costs for the foreign firms, who already face stiff competition from American firms in the U.S. market.This paper models the effects of standards harmonization between countries with different technological capacities. Standards harmonization is effectively a way of eliminating standards as a NTM trade barrier. ",

Organisations that monitor international macro-economic development have identified growing protectionism \u2013 not least the increase in non-tariff barriers to trade, such as local regulations or subsidies \u2013 as a potential cause of the weaker growth in global trade. Non-tariff barriers to trade are a significant element of countries\u2019 trade policies and may often be more harmful than tariff trade barriers. In particular, technical trade barriers and other administrative costs that export companies encounter can inhibit trade. The number of initiated and introduced technical trade barriers increased at the beginning of the financial crisis. Both initiated and introduced technical trade barriers have since remained at high levels. At the same time, the number of international health and safety requirements for food, animal and vegetable products has increased. The average global tariff level has decreased somewhat since the mid- 2000s, which is in contrast to the strong increase in various non-tariff barriers to trade. However, according to a report by Global Trade Alert, since the financial crisis the number of policy measures that restrict trade has increased significantly faster than the number of policy measures that liberalise trade. Research shows that protectionist measures affect international trade negatively. There is thus good reason to believe that the sharp increase in non-tariff barriers in recent years is an important contributing factor to the weaker growth in global trade. ",

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are found to be high users of standard-like NTMs relative to other traditional measures to regulate trade. This begs the question if there has been an intentional shift towards murky protectionism in the region. Grounded on a few criterion to establish potential protectionism, the paper forwards the plausibility of \u201chidden\u201d barriers in the standard-like NTMs in ASEAN, by drawing upon related secondary data and specific illustrative cases of \u201charmful\u201d (discriminatory) and burdensome NTMs in the region. From the narrative experiences of ASEAN, it is inferred that procedural obstacles directly associated with a reported standard-like NTM, instead of the NTM itself, largely account for the \u201chidden\u201d barriers in ASEAN. The paper concludes that irrespective of the motivation for the barriers, whether unintentional or intentional with a protectionist agenda, procedural obstacles deserve attention in their own right.

The new tariffs have affected a significant percentage of Chinese exports to the United States, but their impact on EU trade has only been marginal to date. The indirect effects on European economies through the global value chains have also been limited. However, possible tariff barriers on the automotive sector could raise the affected trade flows substantially.Simulations made with econometric models confirm that the tariff measures adopted to date would have relatively moderate direct effects on global economic activity and on EU countries. That said, the simulations also warn that a decrease in business confidence and an unfavourable reaction by international financial markets could amplify such adverse effects. Additionally, possible future auto sector tariffs could have a significant impact on European economies in an industry already facing important challenges associated with the structural and technological transformation process currently under way.

    "full_abstract": "Since the advent of the GATT regime in the mid-1990s, declines in applied tariff rates and increases in non-tariff measures (NTMs) have been observed. The possibility of NTMs being deployed as protectionist measures in lieu of conventional tariffs has been studied in some literature, for example in Moore and Zanardi (2011) and Beverelli et al. (2014). However, the use of NTMs for protectionist purposes is strictly prohibited by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Their use is only permitted in the protection of human health and the environment, or for the prevention of deceptive practices and so forth. Nevertheless, significant efforts are being made to resolve non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in bilateral or multilateral agreements because in some countries NTMs have been utilized for protectionist purposes, camouflaged by superficially legitimate rhetoric. And even when they are used for legitimate purposes, their limiting effects on trade can be more significant than those of a tariff. Technical barriers to trade (TBTs) refer to regulations or systems that build unnecessary obstacles to international trade in terms of technical requirements for goods to be traded and comprise the largest proportion of NTMs in terms WTO notifications. The TBTs erected by Korea\u2019s trading partners increase the export costs of Korean firms, and thereby function much as classical trade barriers. Since the Korean economy depends highly on trade, there is a need for the Korean government to understand TBTs and to find a way to cope with its trading partners\u2019 TBTs.TBTs function as impediments to trade through the followings: technical regulations and standards, conformity assessment procedures, and labeling requirements. Among them, TBTs originating from norms (technical regulations and standards) can be further divided into two sub-categories: vertical-norm TBTs and horizontal-norm TBTs. Vertical-norm TBTs relate to norms which can be measured by their level of stringency. It occurs when some particular characteristic of a given product, which can vary in scale and scope, is required to meet, exceed or stay below a certain threshold in order to be lawfully marketed. For example, the EU\u2019s Euro VI vehicular emission standards regulate new vehicles sold in EU by limiting exhaust emissions to a certain level. The U.S. fuel economy standards, termed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (or CAFE) standards, which set a limit on the average fuel economy of the vehicles sold in the U.S. by each carmaker, are another example. Horizontal-norm TBTs arise when some of the specifications of a locally-differentiated product are adopted as national standards not used in other countries. U.S vehicle safety standards, the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations (FMVSS), are a good example. In most countries, vehicles are produced according to international safety standards promulgated by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and are viable to sell only if these standards are satisfied. However, the U.S. and Canada follow FMVSS instead. The technology gap is a critical issue in vertical-norm TBTs. The vertical-norm TBTs erected by technologically advanced countries make it difficult for less-advanced countries to penetrate advanced countries\u2019 markets, since many of them do not have the technology to satisfy TBT requirements, causing international disputes. In addition, vertical-norm TBTs are established predominately in developed countries, such as the U.S. and the EU, for purposes of safety, health, environmental protection, and so on. Our analysis thus focuses on vertical-norm TBTs set by developed countries. There are two kinds of vertical-norm TBTs: barriers that limit the maximum values, such as emission standards, and others that establish minimum values, such as fuel economy standards. We concentrate on Minimum Quality Standards (MQS).In view of the above-mentioned characteristics of TBTs, we employ a two-country, vertically-differentiated duopoly model in which a technologically advanced firm competes against a less-advanced firm in quality and price in the domestic market. The government of the technologically advanced country chooses its MQS policy endogenously. Under this structure, we examine the economic effects of MQS and drive the optimal MQS policy of the technologically advanced country considering technological differences. To gain further insight, using the obtained optimal MQS policy of the technologically advanced country, we examine what strategies the government of the less advanced country might employ in response.Several studies have considered MQS in an international context. For example, Motta and Thisse (1999) analyzed the effects of minimum environmental quality standards under autarky and open economy. Boom (1995) set up a model of two segmented countries and examined the effects of differing MQS across countries. Lutz (2000) compared two MQS-setting arrangements, mutual recognition and full harmonization, in a two-country model. Most of these works introduced MQS as exogenous constraints. A notable exception is Petropoulou (2012), who analyzed governments\u2019 incentives for the formation of MQS in an open economy setting. MQS are endogenously determined and are the result of a standard-setting game between governments. However, all these studies assumed that firms in different countries have identical technology. The effects of MQS can differ according to the degree of technological asymmetry among firms, and thus so can optimal MQS policy. Therefore, there is a need to study MQS issues taking into consideration technology gaps between firms.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 builds the model. Section 3 derives market equilibria without MQS. Market equilibria with MQS are derived in Section 4. In Section 5, using the results from the sections 3 and 4, the economic effects of MQS and optimal MQS policies are analyzed. Section 6 provides some policy suggestions for the technologically less advanced country based on the results of the analysis. Concluding remarks follow in Section 7. ",

Using comprehensive data from the Global Trade Alert database, this study systematically assesses how various tariff-and non-tariff barriers implemented abroad affect EU industrial sectors. To address potential endogeneity, a dynamic panel data approach is applied. The findings reveal a mixed picture: while foreign trade protectionism tends to depress sectoral wages, productivity exhibits some gains, suggesting that firms may respond with efficiency improvements to mitigate adverse effects. These results contribute to the limited but growing body of research on the broader consequences of protectionism, particularly the impact of non-tariff trade barriers on affected economies. ",

The results show that an increase in tariffs adversely impacts both export possibilities and, persistently, export values. On the estimates made, a 1% increase in import tariffs imposed by another country on a Spanish product entails a reduction in nominal exports of around 0.6%.

    "full_abstract": "A key objective for the adoption of East African Community (EAC) Customs Union was to enhance economic gains through elimination of tariffs and non\u2010tariff barriers (NTBs) within the member states. This study has established that several NTBs continue to exist, and some have persisted. The NTBs that have persisted for more than three years include a long list of customs documentation requirements, cumbersome formalities, and limited testing and certification arrangements. Other NTBs that still exist include: un\u2010standardized weighbridges; several road blocks; lack of recognition of individual country\u2019s standards; and the existence of several un\u2010harmonised standards. The simulation results of spatial equilibrium model of maize trade with and without NTBs show that at the EAC level there are positive production, trade and welfare implications attributable to elimination of NTBs in intra\u2010regional maize trade. The gains are greatest in trade and production in Uganda compared to Kenya and Tanzania. To eliminate the existing NTBs and to reduce the possibility of new ones being created, first and foremost, the EAC countries need to design effective mechanisms for identifying and verifying information about NTBs and ensuring their elimination. This will require giving the EAC Secretariat the mandate to compel individual countries to eliminate any identified NTB and to ensure that no new ones are created. Second, policy and legislative decisions made by, for example, Council of Ministers should be communicated in time for effective implementation. Broadly, the Government of Uganda (GoU) needs to examine the trade barriers identified in this study and remove those that are internally instituted while working with the rest of the member states to remove those externally imposed. In the specific and medium term, standards should be harmonized and enforcement of compliance be transferred to one regional body, such as EAC Bureau of Standards. In the short run, the EAC countries should develop a mutual recognition of standards across member countries.     ",

    "full_abstract": "Most economists support free trade as the policy which is most conducive to maximizing the economic welfare of a given society. It is argued that free trade allows different economies to take advantage of comparative advantages by the exchange of commodities. However, mainstream economic theory does not rule out protectionism as a welfare maximizing policy option under certain economic conditions. Whether or not a particular economy warrants protection depends on whether it will maximize the economic welfare of its populace. Historically, most economies developed while significant tariffs were in place and high tariffs tended to coincide with relatively high rates of per capita GDP growth. However, after the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, per capita growth was at an all time high while tariffs were at a historically low level. The main argument for protectionism is that of infant industry; industries in newly developing countries can only effectively compete with those already developed if they receive some initial protection from the government in form of tariffs or subsidies. Unfortunately the introduction of such measure can give rise to a beggar-thy-neighbor cycle, whereby trading partners of the nation imposing tariffs retaliate with a tariff on imports. Choosing or rejecting protectionism should be an empirical, not an ideological, question; informed by economic theory and economic history. ",

It assesses the impacts of a 50\\% reduction of non-tariff barriers in four services sectors on bilateral trade in services between ECOWAS (Economic Organization of West African States) and SADC (Southern African Development Community) areas. Using the GTAP model and ad valorem equivalents of services restrictions, we find that services liberalization stimulates GDP and household income in both trading blocks. Bilateral trade in financial, transport, professional, and telecommunication services increases between the two trading blocks and the effects are significant in the long run. SADC member countries export more financial services as a result of ECOWAS macroeconomic and financial integration. ECOWAS benefits from the quality of SADC infrastructures to rise its exports of transport and telecommunication services. South Africa is the biggest exporter in the SADC region and Ghana and Nigeria share the top position in ECOWAS area. Liberalization has beneficial effects on trade only if it is combined with supporting policies aimed at stimulating domestic competition in services sectors. ",

The NTBs were identified through interviews with Brazilian companies and through questionaries sent to Brazilian firms that export over one hundred thousand dollars yearly. Brazilian companies did not identify any NTBs imposed by Paraguay and Uruguay. Argentina, the second largest steel producer in Mercosur, is the only trade partner that uses NTBs when trading steel products with Brazil. This happens because Argentina, in order to avoid a sharp drop in its domestic production, had to protect its firms from external competition after the fall in its internal demand. The Argentine alternative strategy to avoid reducing domestic production would be to raise exports. This became difficult since world prices and demand fell after the Asian Crisis and since Argentine prices are not competitive when compared to its Asian and Eastern European counterparts. The main NTBs imposed by Argentina identified by Brazilian companies are of four types: a) safety and industrial standards and regulations; b) antidumping duties; c) discriminatory bilateral agreements; and d) customs clearance procedures.

Fair trade and tariffs protecting American producers are often promoted as fairer and morally superior policies, however the undesired outcomes of these policies are often unseen and therefore, ignored. Arguments for and against free trade rarely use both morals and economic principles to present their case. Free trade is not only the morally superior policy recommendation, but is the best response to undesirable market outcomes and outsourcing.

We calculate the tariff burden by income decile using Yale Lab data and show that lower-income households bear a disproportionately higher burden. While the tariff cost rises with income, its share relative to income decreases-from 7.15% in the first decile to just 1.13% in the tenth. Dynamic analysis suggests tariffs increase income inequality, with the Gini index rising from 0.605 to 0.621 over two years.

    "full_abstract": "The drastic reductions in bound tariffs agreed by WTO members over the past half century have been accompanied by a substantial rise in non-tariff barriers to trade. Many commentators have drawn a causal link between these two phenomena, but there have been few attempts to empirically test this claim. This lack is particularly apparent with regard to Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, despite their increasing prevalence both in the media and in WTO disputes. SPS measures, like other health and environment regulations, ostensibly serve legitimate national policy objectives and cannot be labeled as \u201cgreen\u201d protectionism merely by considering posterior trade impacts. The determinants of these regulations matter. This paper uses members\u2019 SPS notifications to the WTO at the product level to test the importance of negotiated tariff reductions as a driver for additional SPS regulations. By exploiting time-series, cross-country and cross-product variation in the data we confirm that decreases in bound tariff rates increase the probability of new SPS measures. The policy implications of this result are, however, tempered by our other major finding, namely, that the impact of tariff constraint on SPS notifications is minor compared to that of demographic, governance and environmental variables ",

Since the previous century, multilateral treaties have attempted to create a global framework for trade regulation. In the new era of International Trade, restrictions seem to be reduced because trade is becoming popular in foreign markets. The rise of the internet helps the globalization of international companies. However, the restrictions imposed by governments that use forms of protectionism to save their interests, improve their balance of payments, and highlight their trade policy of rapprochement or confrontation with other States, only cause delays in global economic growth, decrease in available jobs, and decrease in the volume of international trade between countries.

    "full_abstract": "In this paper we examine the dynamics of technical change in the Italian locomotive industry in the period 1850-1913. From an historical point of view, the case of the Italian locomotive industry presents a major point of interest: it was one of the few relatively sophisticated \u201chigh-tech\u201d industries in which Italy, a latecomer country, was able to firmly set foot before 1913. Using technical data on the performance of different vintages of locomotives, we construct a new aggregate index of technical change for the industry. Overall the most successful phase for the Italian locomotive industry seems to be period 1895-1913 characterized by a very rapid technical progress and by the effective consolidation of the technological capabilities in this area of two major firms: Breda and Ansaldo. Our re-assessment reveals the critical role of non-tariff trade barriers  in the development of this industry. ",

While the major G-20 member economies of the international trading system largely refrained from using protectionist instruments that had been used during earlier eras of crisis - such as across-the-board increases in applied tariffs and the imposition of new quantitative restrictions - much of the new protectionism came in the form of potentially WTO-consistent use of temporary trade barriers such as antidumping, countervailing duties, and safeguards. Nevertheless, the incidence of new trade barriers that did take place during the crisis was developing economy-centric in nature: it was disproportionately imposed by developing economies on developing economy exporters with the potential to impact much South-South trade. Finally, the chapter explores policy implications for developing countries in the post-global economic crisis, rules-based trading system. ",

It serves as a globally traded raw material, despite the pervasive barriers implemented on its imports and exports. In this paper, we develop a gravity-based partial equilibrium model to quantify how trade barriers impact trade in steel scrap. To this end, we compile a comprehensive data set on the global steel scrap market. We use it to estimate the price elasticities of scrap supply and demand, as well as a gravity model of international scrap trade. Our data set, which contains information on within-country trade, enables us to identify trade elasticities and the effects of non-tariff barriers. We use the model to simulate barriers to scrap trade. We show that steel scrap demand does not react to scrap price changes in a statistically significant fashion. Scrap supply exhibits a small positive price elasticity. Existing import and export bans reduce scrap trade substantially, but do not prevent it completely, likely reflecting both incomplete bans and smuggling. We estimate a trade elasticity of approximately 6.7 based on import tariffs and export taxes. Other trade barriers, such as quotas and licensing requirements, generally do not have significant effects on scrap trade. Trade barriers directed against individual countries cause large trade redirection effects, but usually have limited impacts on prices and quantities. Indiscriminate trade barriers can have substantial impacts on the scrap market if they are enforced comprehensively. ",

The trade policy legacy he inherited from the Trump administration puts the United States at a crossroads. Will Biden go down the problematic path of executive overreach like his predecessor, or will he forge a new path? We may not need to wait long to find out. In his first trade action, President Biden reinstated tariffs on aluminum from the United Arab Emirates under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to impose tariffs when a certain product is \u201cbeing imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair national security.\u201d Though infrequently used in the past, Section 232 was a favored trade tool of the Trump administration, which was responsible for nearly a quarter of all Section 232 investigations initiated since 1962. While Congress has constitutional authority over trade policy, Section 232 gives the president broad discretion to enact protectionist measures in the name of national security.Why is this law a problem? First, the statute\u2019s lack of an objective definition of \u201cnational security\u201d permits essentially anything to be considered a threat, regardless of the merits. Second, the law\u2019s lack of detailed procedural requirements encouraged the Trump administration to cut corners in applying the law, thus breeding cronyism and confusion. Third, President Trump took advantage of the law\u2019s ambiguity to shield key Section 232 findings from Congress and the public, undermining both transparency and accountability.The Trump administration\u2019s abuse of the rarely used Section 232 has allowed the statute to become an excuse for blatant commercial protectionism, harming American companies and consumers and our security interests. It\u2019s unclear whether the Biden administration will continue this troubling trend or seek reform. The best course of action would be the latter: Biden should avoid using Section 232 and support congressional efforts to rein in presidential power, thus ensuring an end to the calamitous episodes that were common during the Trump era.

All this is reflected in the gradual effective trade integration with the EU; i.e. in growing bilateral trade flows. The overall EU tariffs for Ukrainian products are rather low and other tradition protection measures apply to selective sectors only. Moreover they are expected to disappear gradually within the next few years, following Ukraine WTO entry and expected establishment of the free trade area in manufacturing goods between the EU and Ukraine. However, there exist other so called 'non-tariff\u2019 barriers to trade that protect and will protect the EU market. For a relatively poorer country these barriers may turn to be prohibitive.

To address these questions, we develop a new value-added approach to modelling tariff setting with GVCs, in which optimal policy depends on the nationality of value-added content embedded in home and foreign final goods. Theory predicts that discretionary tariffs will be decreasing in the domestic content of foreign-produced final goods and (provided foreign political interests are not too strong) the foreign content of domestically-produced final goods. Using theory as a guide, we estimate the influence of GVC linkages on trade policy with newly assembled data on bilateral applied tariffs, temporary trade barriers, and value-added contents for 14 major economies over the 1995-2009 period. Our empirical findings indicate that GVCs already play an important role in shaping trade policy. Governments set lower tariffs and curb their use of temporary trade protection (particularly against China) where GVC linkages are strongest. ",

Yet, detailed economic data reveals that in countries with lower tariff rates (developed countries), the use of NTMs is significantly lower compared to developing countries, which implies a possible complementary effect between tariffs and NTMs across nations. Using a dataset of Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2009) on ad valorem tariff equivalents of NTMs, at a very disaggregated product level, this paper explores the determinants of NTMs and their substitutability/complementarity relations with tariff barriers. While exploiting the country variation, it demonstrates the decreasing trend of substitutability between the two import policy instruments with the rise in economic development. In particular, a significant complementarity correlation exists between the two trade measures among the wealthiest nations, implying a stronger commitment to freer trade. ",

These policies characterized by the use of tariffs and other trade barriers have impacted the world beyond just the economic or financial effect between countries involved. The paper focuses on the long-term effect of trade wars and tariff policies on global trade and economic relationship between countries. Using historical and modern trade war scenarios such as USA-China trade war, the study indicates that disruption of global supply chain, volatility of financial market, and impact on specific sectors of the country economy such as agriculture are some of the long-term impacts of these policies on global trade. In terms of the impact on economic relationship between countries, the study highlights creation of new trade agreements and diversification of trade partnership as possible effects on economic relationship between countries. It is therefore imperative for countries to diversify their trade relationship by adopting initiatives against the effects of trade war. The study concludes that while national measures could bring some political and economic results in the short term, it is important to note that global prosperity cannot be long-lasting without cooperative and stable international trade policies.

China's recent actions seeking to set its own unique standards instead of adopting international standards shifts focus to the impact on international trade and the corresponding legal framework defining responsibilities for State members of the World Trade Organization.  While trade barriers of the past - high tariffs and quotas imposed on imports - have been greatly reduced, less obvious impediments normally referred to as non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have in many cases replaced them.  One area ripe for the incursion of NTBs concerns technology standards.  The WTO's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade recognizes the important contribution that international standards can make by improving efficiency of production and facilitating the conduct of international trade, but also cautions that standards should not be used to create NTBs.  China's WAPI standard provides a test-case for ICT standards and their relationship to the international trade regime. It serves to illustrate standards' dual nature as trade facilitators and indispensable elements of the ICT industry, on the one hand, and as potential measures of protectionism when applied inappropriately, on the other hand.  As China's economic power grows and it becomes more adept at playing the standards game, it may find new means for pressing its own concerns in relation to international standards and trade-related issues.

We develop more comprehensive measures of trade policy that include the temporary trade barrier (TTB) policies of antidumping and safeguards. Studies in other contexts have similarly shown how these policies can erode some of the trade liberalization gains that appear based on an assessment of tariffs alone. We examine the experiences of Argentina and Brazil during the formation of the Mercosur customs union (1990\u20132001) and find that an exclusive focus on applied tariffs may lead to a mischaracterization of the relationship between preferential liberalization and liberalization toward nonmember countries. We find that any \u201cbuilding block\u201d evidence associated with a focus on tariffs during the period in which Mercosur was a free trade area can disappear once we include changes in import protection from TTBs. Furthermore, there is evidence of a \u201cstumbling block\u201d effect of preferential tariff liberalization for the period in which Mercosur became a customs union, and this result tends to strengthen upon inclusion of TTBs. Finally, we provide a first empirical examination of whether market power motives can help explain the patterns of changes to import protection that are observed in these settings. ",

In this paper we present and discuss two main objections to this view: the first is that current and trade account disequilibria are ultimately due to differences between domestic savings and investments driven by macroeconomic fundamentals which in general do not depend only on the trade policies of foreign countries. The second objection consists in the fact that the role of the US dollar as the \u201cworld\u2019s money\u201d in the current asymmetric international monetary system makes the US trade deficit both inevitable and sustainable in the long run.

By reference to panel data of bilateral trade between China and 95 trade partners during 2006-2015, this paper probes into the impacts of overall and individual indicators of trade liberalization (i.e. tariff and non-tariff barriers) and trade facilitation (i.e. Infrastructure, E-Commerce, Financial Market, Government Regulation and Customs Environment) on China\u2019s agricultural trade cost. Furthermore, the heterogeneity is analyzed in the \u201cBelt and Road\u201d countries and the non \u201cBelt and Road\u201d countries, developing countries and developed countries. The paper finds that perseverance in trade liberalization is an effective way to reduce agricultural trade cost, in which lifting of non-tariff barriers is a crux. Compared with advancing trade liberalization, it is urgently needed for China to work with trade partners of agricultural products to jointly launch trade facilitation reforms according to the priority order of Financial Market, E-Commerce, Infrastructure and Customs Environment.

We obtain sizable deadweight losses for the United States, particularly in the Electronic and ICT; Electrical; and Furniture industries. We also find that, with a leakage rate of 20 percent, total losses to U.S. consumers and importers are $3.3 billion, about 0.05 percent of gross U.S. output, whereas the full leakage losses are $10.7 billion, or 0.16 percent of gross U.S. output, which is twice as much as the annual welfare gains from the North America Free Trade Agreement.

To address this puzzle we derive and test predictions for a set of policies where detailed data is available and an efficiency ranking is feasible: tariffs vs. non-tariff barriers (NTBs). In our policy choice model a government bargaining with domestic SIGs can gain by constraining tariffs through international agreements even if this leads to the use of the less efficient NTBs. This generates two key testable predictions (i) there is imperfect policy substitution, i.e. tighter tariff constraints are not fully offset by the higher NTBs they generate and (ii) the decision to commit to constraints depends on the government's bargaining power relative to SIGs. Using detailed data, we confirm that tariff constraints in trade agreements increase the likelihood and restrictiveness of NTBs. We also provide a structural estimate that indicates NTBs are less efficient than the tariffs they imperfectly replace. Moreover, we find parametric and non-parametric evidence that the higher the government bargaining power relative to a SIG the more relaxed the tariff constraint it chooses. This result is stronger for organized industries, which further supports the theory. The main theoretical insights and empirical approach can be applied to other policies to provide additional evidence on inefficient redistribution. ",

Crosscountry variation reflects three main drivers: tariff exposure, fiscal fundamentals, and export orientation. Bonds from countries facing higher tariffs experience stronger gains, but this effect weakens for sovereigns with poor credit quality or high unemployment. Moreover, bonds issued by net exporters underperform, suggesting that investor concerns center on structural vulnerabilities rather than general trade openness.

Each and every country is engaged in trade by selling its products, obtaining what it lacks and manufacturing more precisely in certain sectors than its 9 rivals. This has emerged the need for scholars and researchers to comprehend the concepts of globalization, free trade, trade liberalism, trade protectionism, trade barriers, and international trade. However, the literature regarding the benefits of free trade, trade liberalism, globalization and the demerits of inward-looking economies is still evolving. Thus, the current review paper aims to highlight the impact of free trade and trade liberalization on the development of the world economy. Moreover, it aims to assess the effect of globalization on international trade practices and analyze the impacts of trade barriers and trade protectionism on world economies. The current study eventually believes that it is difficult for the inward looking economies to sustain in the long run, thus the economies must adopt free trade practices and globalization to be successful in the competitive world.

In 2015 they formed the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) designed to promote the free flow of goods, services, labor and capital, as Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic joined. Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan all had to approximately double their average external tariff to implement the common external tariff. Russia has benefited from additional exports under the protection of the higher tariffs. Estimates reveal that the tariff changes resulted in substantial transfers from Kazakhstan to Russia (with similar impacts expected for Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic) as importers in Kazakhstan now purchase lower quality or higher priced Russian imports that are protected under the tariff umbrella of the common external tariff. Transfers from the Central Asian countries to Russia were the reason the predecessor to the EAEU (known as EurAsEC) failed, so this bodes badly for the ultimate success of the EAEU. But Russia\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization will substantially lower the common external tariff and reduce the transfers to Russia. Further, unlike EurAsEC, the EAEU aims to employ \u201cdeep integration,\u201d e.g., to reduce non-tariff barriers and improve trade facilitation, create a single market, reduce trade distorting agricultural subsidies and harmonize some regulations. Estimates show that if substantial progress could be made in trade facilitation and reducing non-tariff barriers, this could make the Customs Union positive for Kazakhstan and other potential Central Asian members. And the right to work for migrants may dominate these issues for Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic. Unfortunately, as of early 2016, the EAEU has not improved trade facilitation or reduced non-tariff barriers. To effectively implement the objectives of the EAEU, however, Russia will need to take the lead in ceding real authority to the Eurasian Commission and press for reforms, including those that reduce the substantial internal non-tariff barriers.

Of 125 nations examined in this report, 31 impose combined ICT tax and tariff rates of over 5 percent of product or service costs, with several countries adding more than 20 percent to costs. Another 40 countries impose taxes and tariffs of between 1 and 5 percent. Economic studies demonstrate that these added costs limit ICT adoption which slows productivity growth.

It is based on a poll of 530 Russian, Kazakh and Belarusian exporters. In the research non-tariff barriers are divided into two groups. The first group includes non-tariff barriers such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, quotas, prohibitions, and quantitative controls. The second group comprises price and competition controls (the institute of \u201cspecial importers,\u201d sale restrictions, restrictions on public procurement, various subsidies). The second group of barriers is often referred to as \u201csand in the wheels,\u201d because it hinders the movement of goods and in principle can be fully removed. The authors have come to a conclusion that this very group of barriers possesses a more negative influence on trade. Therefore, the main policy efforts should be directed at removing \u201csand in the wheels\u201d of mutual trade. ",

Since its establishment in 1995, the WTO (World Trade Organization) has discussed this subject in the trade and environment committee. One of the main issues is lowering tariff levels and the reduction and elimination of non-tariff barriers on EGS.With regard to trade liberalization of environment-related goods in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting of 2012, it was agreed that discussions on trade liberalization will be focused on 54 items by HS 6-digit classification. Among these 54 items, the photovoltaic equipment solar panels, wind power generators, sorting crushers for recycling, liquid filters, and precision equipment for environmental analysis are included. Moreover, even in the WTO, Japan, US, EU, South Korea, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and Canada started negotiations in January 2014 of a tariff reduction for new environment-related goods in volunteer countries in order to achieve both environmental protection and trade promotion.While Korea\u2019s exports of environmental goods and services remained under the level of 5 billion US dollars in the early 1990s, it soared to over 40 billion US dollars in 2013.This article analyzes Korea\u2019s EGS trade toward China according to the category of common OECD/WTO/APEC EGS classification. Of course, recent trends and issues of trade liberalization of EGS among international institutions such as WTO and APEC are summarized, and the conclusion suggests some policy implications. ",

The Poison Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator accounts for heteroskedasticity and the presence of zero trade flows. Our results identify which regulations can adversely affect trade, providing useful information to policy-makers involved in negotiations on trade frictions. While sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not seem to obstruct exports, technical barriers have a varying impact on trade. A decreasing trend for tariffs has largely been compensated by more stringent technical barriers. The overall result is that frictions in the world wine trade have not changed during the past fifteen years. ",

At the same time, trade in health products is hampered by substantive trade barriers. In this paper, we present evidence that countries around the world still apply tariffs and nontariff measures that increase prices and limit the availability of health-related products such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and medical equipment. The case for liberalizing trade in these products is therefore strong. In addition, we show that improving trade facilitation performance, using the World Trade Organization\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement as a starting point, can be linked to improved handling of health-related products such as vaccines which, in turn, would boost usage. In the last part of the paper, we study the price differences for insulin across countries. We observe that the price of insulin has various determinants, one of them being open trade: the higher the level of competition between manufacturers, the lower the price of insulin. In summary, lowering trade barriers on health products can make a substantive contribution to building up health systems and lowering out-of-pocket payments of patients. ",

This underperformance has been due to both policy-related variables \u2014 relatively high tariff and non-tariff barriers \u2014 and high trade costs due to inefficient \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d infrastructure (costly transport links and problems related to trade facilitation). The goal of this study is to estimate the potential gains from South Asian-Southeast Asian economic integration using an advanced computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The paper estimates the potential gains to be large, particularly for South Asia, assuming that the policy- and infrastructure-related variables that increase trade costs are reduced via economic cooperation and investment in connectivity. As Myanmar is a key inter-regional bridge and has recently launched ambitious, outward-oriented policy reforms, the prospects for making progress in these areas are strong. If the two regions succeed in dropping inter-regional tariffs, reducing non-tariff barriers by 50%, and decreasing South Asian-Southeast Asian trade costs by 15% \u2014 which this paper suggests is ambitious but attainable \u2014 welfare in South Asia and Southeast Asia would rise by 8.9% and 6.4% of gross domestic product, respectively, by 2030 relative to the baseline. These gains would be driven by rising exports and competitiveness, particularly for South Asia, whose exports would rise by two thirds (64% relative to the baseline). Hence, the paper concludes that improvements in connectivity would justify a high level of investment. Moreover, it supports a two-track approach to integration in South Asia, i.e., deepening intra-regional cooperation together with building links to Southeast Asia. ",

    "full_abstract": "The U.S. steel industry has a long history of being protected, first when it was an infant industry in 1791 and later as it became a mature industry and needed breathing room to allow it to restructure so that it could compete against more efficient foreign producers. In recent years the steel industry has resorted to antidumping laws to ward off foreign competition. In the first quarter of 2002, President Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on foreign steel producers in many countries, including those in East Asia. This tariff, which was the result of a finding that some foreign steel companies had dumped their steel on the American market, may be the first shot in what might become a trade war. A number of countries have filed protests with the WTO seeking compensation for the tariff and some countries have already taken retaliatory measures. These recent trade actions have a ripple effect throughout the East Asian countries, including Korea, and the world. For example, if the United States market becomes closed to the steel companies in the EU, those steel companies will have to try to sell more steel within the EU at a time when Chinese, Korean and Japanese steel companies will also be trying to penetrate the EU market to make up for lost American sales. This paper will explore some of these issues, with an emphasis on the effects that steel protectionism in the United States will have on their industries and their economies. A different version of this paper was first published in 2002 and was reprinted in 2009. The present version includes a bibliography on trade, including links to more than 100 studies on trade. ",

This paper takes a look at the protectionist measures placed upon services, (the TBT Non-Tariff Barriers in the services industry). Protectionism was seen as a distorting element within international product trade, the consequence was the dismantlement of many tariffs to increase trade in goods. However with increased interest in services since 2000, protectionist measures have gained momentum in the subject of multilateral trade in services. The paper examines the international regulations distorting the globalisation of services, within the European mobile telecommunications industry. ",

This paper uses a computable general equilibrium trade model calibrated with the latest version of the GTAP database to simulate the effect of doubling non-tariff barriers - both unilateral and reciprocal - between the two blocks on trade and welfare. Imposing trade barriers almost completely eliminates bilateral imports. In addition, changes in price levels lead to higher imports and lower exports of the imposing country group from and to the rest of the world. The targeted country group increases exports to the rest of the world and reduces imports. Welfare falls in all countries involved, suggesting that governments should strive to cooperate rather than turning away from each other. By imposing a trade war on Russia, the political West could inflict severe damage on the Russian economy because of the latter\u2019s smaller relative size. ",

Instead, the findings of the study based on an augmented gravity model suggest that NTMs promote intra-regional exports, irrespective of broad commodity types. The popular perception of the pervasive nature of NTMs, based on the frequency and types of NTMs, is plausibly flawed as the export coverage of NTMs for the various bilateral pairs is not astoundingly high to deter intra-regional trade. This study therefore informs the policy debate on the non-issue of NTMs per se in posing any significant market access problems for intra-ASEAN trade. ",

Yet, at the same time there has been a notable increase in the use of non-tariff measures (NTM) for many products in most countries. In this environment, technical barriers to trade (TBT)\u2014a sub-category of NTM and one of the main obstacles to trade\u2014are crucial factors firms must take into consideration when exporting goods. Since Korea relies largely on exports for economic growth, it is necessary for the government to understand the economic impact of TBT.One of the main objectives of the EU is to prevent the erection of trade barriers within its borders. It follows that the coordination of technical regulations among EU member states is of a vital importance. The EU currently employs two main approaches to coordination : Harmonization (HR) and Mutual Recognition (MR). In harmonized fields, all member states agree to adopt uniform technical regulations.The European Union is Korea\u2019s third-largest trading partner by volume, after China and the U.S. In addition, it plays a leading role in the design and implementation of new TBT that are consequently adopted by many other countries. In this paper, I analyze the impact of the EU\u2019s TBT on Korean exports. In particular, I study the impact under the EU\u2019s various approaches to removing TBT among member countries. ",

While tariffs have decreased over the decades, the increasing application of environmental-related requirements are a new factor that affects international business. These new requirements not only modify companies\u2019 decision-making processes at national and international levels, but also within the firm. Hence, this paper proposes to examine the application of such measures by the European Union in the tea, coffee and yerba mate market, and their impact on exporting Latin-American firms for the 1995-2015 period and analyze whether there has been an improvement in their productive quality. For this aim, through a qualitative methodology, we carried out interviews with specialists of the field and surveys to Latin-American exporting companies. In this way, this analysis discusses with theorists if the application of measures related to environmental sustainability leads to ameliorate firms\u2019 productive quality. Among the results, it is highlighted the fact that non-tariff measures \u2014 in particular sanitary and phytosanitary ones \u2014 have been used as trade barriers. However, complying with them allows exporting companies to develop environmental performance strategies and ultimately, it leads to a positive growth in their productive quality in the medium-long term.

In their view, the customs reform of the mid-17th century did not actually pursue any patronizing goals for the development of domestic production. Defending the thesis about the establishment of large-scale industry in Russia in the first quarter of the 18th century, they assign the main role to the customs and tariff policy in updating the country\u2019s production apparatus.

    "full_abstract": "It is an acknowledged fact that traders employ different tactics to circumvent trade barriers imposed by governments, including trade evasions, avoidance, misclassification, and substitution of similar products. The barriers, justified in terms of home protection and industrial developments, become significant during a crisis. We assess a substantial import prohibition policy in Iran that began in 2018 and has continued until now. The policy was imposed after the currency crisis, followed by the unilateral withdrawal of President Trump from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The policy prohibited more than 1300 products at 8-digit of Harmonized System (HS), from which57% are consumption goods. In this study, we employ a measure of illegal import, which is the difference between reported imports by the Iran Customs Administration and the reported exports by the mirror data obtained from the World Integrated Trade Solutions, with an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, can be applied to zero importation of prohibited goods after the policy. We define prohibited goods as the treatment, and others as the controls and employ methodologies of causal inferences, including difference-in-difference (DiD) and event studies. Other covariates, suchas tariffs, value-added tax (VAT), and products\u2019 fixed effects at the HS6 level, are controlled.  Findings indicate that the policy caused a 20% rise in illegal imports. Many robustness tests confirm the results, like controlling for mean reversion and adding specific trends at HS2. While the literature provides a local estimate of about 2% for the elasticity of illegal imports with respect to tariffs, we contribute by providing a substantial estimate for the tails of the distribution of this elasticity. As advice to policymakers who aim to control the demand for foreign currency through prohibition, our results show how effective a prohibition policy can be. Albeit, based on the experts\u2019 statements and non-academic reports, other measures like misclassifications and barter informal trade are widely used to circumvent this policy, which could be measured in future studies using richer datasets.

This paper evaluates the trade barriers faced by India in China\u2019s market focusing mainly on electrical machinery sector. The empirical analysis shows that China has hidden trade barriers in electrical machinery sector by replacing the use of ad-valorem tariff with non-ad valorem tariff (AVE\u2019s). This study will help India to address the issue of market access and demand removal of trade barriers in the electrical machinery sector while negotiating at the RCEP with China to address the issue of trade imbalance.

    "full_abstract": "With tariff barriers to trade having been greatly reduced through successive multilateral and regional/bilateral/unilateral trade liberalization, trade policy has increasingly come to focus on non-tariff measures (NTMs). The term \u201ctrade facilitation\u201d is sometimes broadly used to cover policy efforts aimed at addressing product-specific measures such as product standards, and general trade procedures such as the cost of clearing customs, that might go beyond the legitimate regulatory purposes of ensuring health, safety or technical requirements and serve as a non-tariff barrier (NTB). There are both conceptual issues and practical complications in measuring the trade impact of specific regulations, which often specify requirements such as minimum quality, maximum toxicity, technical compatibility, and rules for demonstrating conformity, since these requirements affect the nature as well as the cost of a product and often address externalities such as environmental impacts. Moreover, the total impact of NTMs is also determined by, inter alia, choice of administrative procedures, the efficiency with which inspection and certification is carried out, and level of fees charged, not to mention the response of demand to changes which might be introduced. Reflecting this complexity, even the highly detailed regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) routinely conducted when specific regulations are being considered by legislatures rarely attempt a quantification of trade impacts. In the face of this information gap, quantitative assessments of trade facilitation rely on very crude and indirect methods of inferring these trade impacts. Methods include the construction of tariff-equivalents (derived, for example, from indexes for highly aggregated bundles of goods based on counts of measures without reference to their nature, or backed out of gravity model-based residuals), the intensity of liberalization implied by the \u201cair time\u201d given to facilitation measures in the text of trade agreements, or even  simple assumptions of across-the-board cost reductions. This paper attempts to shed light on the potential impact of a trade agreement on NTBs by drilling down and examining in detail the specific nature of, commercial concerns with, and amenability to treatment through trade agreements of a series of known frictions in Canada-EU trade: namely  eco-labelling (tissue paper), product certification marks (construction-related wood products), registration and documentation (chemical products), recycling and waste management (electronic products), phasing out of specific substances (heavy metals), product certification fees (civil aircraft and parts), safety standards (motor vehicles and parts) and a range of agriculture and food-related regulations (including measures relating to labeling, quarantine, use of hormones and growth additives, animal hygiene, genetic modification, bulk alcoholic beverages, and pharmaceutical approval procedures).  The difficulties identified of quantification of known trade irritants underscore the speculative nature of trade facilitation impacts in the quantitative trade modeling literature. ",

Taking into account the fact that not all non-tariff measures act as barriers, authors form the methodology for their categorization in accordance with existing approaches created by international organizations and emerging types of non-tariff measures. Taking into account the fact that NTMs have the greatest impact on the trade in agricultural goods and food as well as Russia's high positions in the global markets of these goods, authors assess the impact of non-tariff measures on the trade of goods under consideration for the Russian side.

    "full_abstract": "Purpose \u2013 As the U.S.-China trade war has become considerably worse, the Chinese government is considering applying non-tariff barriers to trade, especially local contents rule. The main purpose of this research is to check whether it is suitable for Korean investors to invest in the current Chinese capital market. Design/methodology \u2013 In order to check the stability of the recent Chinese capital market, we investigated the behavior of foreign equity investment (including Korean equity investment) in the Chinese capital market after China announced the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect (SH-HK Connect). In this paper, we researched whether international portfolio investment would or would not contribute to an increase the volatility of an emerging market\u2019s stock market (Chinese capital market) when foreign investors make investment decisions based on the objective of short-term gains by rushing into countries whose markets are booming and fleeing from countries whose markets are falling. Findings \u2013 The empirical results indicate that foreign investors show strong, negative feedback trading behavior with regard to the stock index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and when the performance of foreign investors in the Chinese stock market was fairly good. Also, we found evidence that the behavior of foreign investors significantly decreased volatility in SSE stock returns. Consequently, the SH-HK Connect brought on a win-win effect for both the Chinese capital market and foreign investors. Originality/value \u2013 It appeared that the Chinese capital market was very suitable for Korean investors after the China\u2019s declaration of the SH-HK Connect. However, the win-win effect was brought on by the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive capital control but the capital controls could possibly cause financial turmoil in the Chinese capital market. Therefore, Chinese reform in industrial structure and the financial sector should keep pace with suitable capital control policies. ",

To exemplify this, we provide a quantitative assessment of the aggregate and distributional effects of one hypothetical protectionist measure \u2013 the case of revoking the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Using a multi-sector quantitative model of global production, we show that a full revocation extending to both tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers would result in a real annual GDP loss of US$ 37 billion in Canada, US$ 22 billion in Mexico, and US$ 40 billion in the United States. In contrast, annual combined losses would amount to less than US$ 5 billion if only tariff rates would be increased. However, in both scenarios, average real wages would fall in almost all regions in North America. ",

    "full_abstract": "Private standards have increasingly become a contentious issue in the multilateral trading system. The ever increasing number of sector-specific standards developed by businesses, in particular in the food market, may have significant implications for developing countries in terms of market access. Some countries see private food standards as a particular form of non-tariff barriers. The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with non-tariff barriers in the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). This paper examines to what extent these agreements cover private standards, as they were originally intended to regulate standard-setting by public authorities. We find that there is an important difference between the SPS Agreement and the TBT Agreement in that the drafters of the latter realized the importance of the private sector in standard-setting. Finally, we discuss whether a \u2018Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards\u2019, similar to that under the TBT Agreement, could be adopted under the SPS Agreement.

Using firm-level panel data from T\u00fcrkiye with fixed effects, we show that international data limitations significantly affect empirical results and that the explanatory power of the gravity model declines with more detailed microdata. We also find that the STRI's link to trade flows is weaker and more sector-specific than assumed, questioning its methodological adequacy. Additionally, ad valorem equivalent (AVE) rates are estimated, revealing moderate barriers for T\u00fcrkiye's exports but much higher protection in imports, notably in technical services and transport. The findings highlight the need for sector-specific liberalization and call for next-generation STRI indices that are dynamic, firm-responsive, and modular by regulatory dimension. We advocate for cautious interpretation of STRI-based estimates and encourage the use of microdata across countries to improve services trade analysis and policy design. ",

It acknowledges that international trade cannot be avoided and countries need to adapt to the requirements of trade facilitation with reference to the Trade Facilitation Agreement. It seeks to clarify the \u2018assumption that facilitating trade leads to loss of revenue and how trade facilitation can reinforce revenue collections at a lower cost. The paper explores further on trade facilitation benefits the private sector have as they seek to trade internationally. With the increase in trade volumes countries through their customs administration requires trade facilitation measures to ensure no non-tariff barriers hinder trade. There is also need to capacitate these customs administration in the adoption of these trade facilitation measures before any policy framework can be implemented at national or regional level. Major reasons put forward for trade facilitation measures are increased trade in finished products by developing countries, globalisation of manufacturing processes, proliferation of regional trade agreements and continued diversification of exports. In summary trade needs to be facilitated if developing countries are to benefit from international trade and the most influential actors are customs administrations. With trade facilitation measures developing countries might even collect more revenue than previously collected before these measures are in place. ",

The dominant party sets the agenda, but parties must agree to any change from the status quo. When domestic and foreign status quo tariffs are low, and in the absence of transfers, the protectionist agenda-setter will offer high tariffs, agreed to by globalists in exchange for a share of tariff revenue\u2014as was the case when the Republicans initiated the \u201cEra of Restriction\" after the Civil War. When the status quo trade policy is high unilateral (and foreign) tariffs, e.g., U.S. 1860-1931, a free trade bargain is available only if accompanied by sufficiently high domestic transfers to the protectionists. In the 1930s, the globalist Democratic party offered the protectionist Republican party transfers to replace the benefits of the tariff, ushering in the \"Era of Reciprocity with Redistribution.\" When transfers are too low, a consensus emerges for a \"Retreat\" from free trade, especially in the face of rising imports. We conclude that the recent rise of China as an exporter of capital-intensive manufactures is not sufficient to explain the unilateral imposition of tariffs by the U.S. beginning in 2018; domestic social transfers that are too low are also to be blamed.

Using detailed project-level data on new greenfield FDI as well as complementary research, this paper tracks the differential changes in FDI across countries and industries most affected by the trade tensions. There is some evidence of diversion to South-East Asia in specific industries, confirming findings of other research, but the aggregate effect on investment in China is limited and the overall effect on investment in South-East Asia is actually negative. A possible explanation lies in the importance of global value chain linkages as key determinants of firms\u2019 investment decisions. ",
